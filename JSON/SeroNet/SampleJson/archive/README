This is example code for parsing a SeroNet Registry Template,
creating JSON files that can be used for AWS OpenSearch Indexing.

The SampleTemplates directory contains 19 templates downloaded
from the DR45 data release.

The SampleJson directory contains example output produced by
running the parseRegistryTemplate.py program using each template
as input. The output files are SDYXXX.orig. The createSuggessions.py
program can be used to update every SDYXXX.orig file in a directory,
by adding the "suggestions" property. In the future, the generation
of the JSON and the addition of the "suggestions" content, could
be merged into one program.

In the bin directory there are 2 examples illustrating how you
can run the parseRegistryTemplate.py program from a Shell script.
The are only examples.

The parseRegistryTemplate.py is an example of one way to parse
the Excel input file. Another way would be to use one of the Python
Excel libraries to do the parsing. In either case the programs would
need to be updated if the format of the Excel sheet changes.
