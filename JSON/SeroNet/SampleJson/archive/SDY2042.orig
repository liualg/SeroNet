    "study_description": "The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to evade neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccination or infection. Despite the global spread of the Omicron variant, even among highly vaccinated populations, death rates have not increased concomitantly. These data suggest that immune mechanisms beyond antibody-mediated virus neutralization may protect against severe disease. In addition to neutralizing pathogens, antibodies contribute to control and clearance of infections through Fc effector mechanisms. Here, we probed the ability of vaccine-induced antibodies to drive Fc effector activity against the Omicron variant using samples from individuals receiving one of three SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Despite a substantial loss of IgM, IgA, and IgG binding to the Omicron variant receptor binding domain (RBD) in samples from individuals receiving BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and CoronaVac vaccines, stable binding was maintained against the full-length Omicron Spike protein. Compromised RBD binding IgG was accompanied by a loss of RBD-specific antibody Fc\u03b3 receptor (Fc\u03b3R) binding in samples from individuals who received the CoronaVac vaccine, but RBD-specific Fc\u03b3R2a and Fc\u03b3R3a binding was preserved in recipients of mRNA vaccines. Conversely, Spike protein-specific antibodies exhibited persistent but reduced binding to Fc\u03b3Rs across all three vaccines, although higher binding was observed in samples from recipients of mRNA vaccines. This was associated with preservation of Fc\u03b3R2a and Fc\u03b3R3a binding antibodies and maintenance of Spike protein-specific antibody-dependent natural killer cell activation. Thus, despite the loss of Omicron neutralization, vaccine-induced Spike protein-specific antibodies continue to drive Fc effector functions, suggesting a capacity for extraneutralizing antibodies to contribute to disease control.",
