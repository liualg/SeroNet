Discovery and functional interrogation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-host protein interactions	N		2.0	N	SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of a pandemic with growing global mortality. Using comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS), we identified 309 host proteins that bind the SARS-CoV-2 RNA during active infection. Integration of this data with ChIRP-MS data from three other RNA viruses defined viral specificity of RNA-host protein interactions. Targeted CRISPR screens revealed that the majority of functional RNA-binding proteins protect the host from virus-induced cell death, and comparative CRISPR screens across seven RNA viruses revealed shared and SARS-specific antiviral factors. Finally, by combining the RNA-centric approach and functional CRISPR screens, we demonstrated a physical and functional connection between SARS-CoV-2 and mitochondria, highlighting this organelle as a general platform for antiviral activity.

4	SDY1800		3.0		Years	Most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals develop S-RBD specific, class-switched rMBCs that resemble germinal center derived B cells induced by effective vaccination against other pathogens, providing evidence for durable B cell mediated immunity against SARS-CoV-2 after mild or severe disease.	Durable SARS-CoV-2 B cell immunity after mild or severe disease	N		2.0	N	Multiple studies have shown loss of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-specific (SARS-CoV-2-specific) antibodies over time after infection, raising concern that humoral immunity against the virus is not durable. If immunity wanes quickly, millions of people may be at risk for reinfection after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, memory B cells (MBCs) could provide durable humoral immunity even if serum neutralizing antibody titers decline. We performed multidimensional flow cytometric analysis of S protein receptor binding domain-specific (S-RBD-specific) MBCs in cohorts of ambulatory patients with COVID-19 with mild disease (n = 7), and hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease (n = 7), at a median of 54 days (range, 39-104 days) after symptom onset. We detected S-RBD-specific class-switched MBCs in 13 of 14 participants, failing only in the individual with the lowest plasma levels of anti-S-RBD IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Resting MBCs (rMBCs) made up the largest proportion of S-RBD-specific MBCs in both cohorts. FCRL5, a marker of functional memory on rMBCs, was more dramatically upregulated on S-RBD-specific rMBCs after mild infection than after severe infection.

5	SDY1800		3.0		Years	Most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals develop S-RBD specific, class-switched rMBCs that resemble germinal center derived B cells induced by effective vaccination against other pathogens, providing evidence for durable B cell mediated immunity against SARS-CoV-2 after mild or severe disease.	Durable SARS-CoV-2 B cell immunity after mild or severe disease	N		2.0	N	Multiple studies have shown loss of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-specific (SARS-CoV-2-specific) antibodies over time after infection, raising concern that humoral immunity against the virus is not durable. If immunity wanes quickly, millions of people may be at risk for reinfection after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, memory B cells (MBCs) could provide durable humoral immunity even if serum neutralizing antibody titers decline. We performed multidimensional flow cytometric analysis of S protein receptor binding domain-specific (S-RBD-specific) MBCs in cohorts of ambulatory patients with COVID-19 with mild disease (n = 7), and hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease (n = 7), at a median of 54 days (range, 39-104 days) after symptom onset. We detected S-RBD-specific class-switched MBCs in 13 of 14 participants, failing only in the individual with the lowest plasma levels of anti-S-RBD IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Resting MBCs (rMBCs) made up the largest proportion of S-RBD-specific MBCs in both cohorts. FCRL5, a marker of functional memory on rMBCs, was more dramatically upregulated on S-RBD-specific rMBCs after mild infection than after severe infection. These data indicate that most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals develop S-RBD-specific, class-switched rMBCs that resemble germinal center-derived B cells induced by effective vaccination against other pathogens, providing evidence for durable B cell-mediated immunity against SARS-CoV-2 after mild or severe disease.	10.21430/M3YQ1SXVS6	N	Adult, Aged, Antibodies, Neutralizing blood, B-Lymphocytes immunology, Binding Sites immunology, COVID-19 immunology, virology, Case-Control Studies, Cohort Studies, Female, Humans, Immunity Cellular, Immunoglobulin Class Switching, Immunologic Memory, Male, Middle Aged, Pandemics, SARS-CoV-2 immunology, Severity of Illness Index, Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus chemistry, Time Factors		Other		2022-03-21 00:00:00.0	DR43	None	2022-03-21 00:00:00.0	DR43	76.0	32.0		Durable SARS-CoV-2 B cell immunity after mild or severe disease	2022-03-21 00:00:00.0	Y	NIAID, CEIRS, Other			mrbast_20210630_29206	PMID33571162	6661.0	2021-06-30 15:10:09.0	mrbast	2022-08-14 18:37:07.0	heschaefer	4948.0	2021-12-01 17:44:39.0	Zhiping.gu	2021-12-01 17:44:39.0	Zhiping.gu	NIH	The goal of the Johns Hopkins Excellence in Pathogenesis and Immunity Center for SARS-CoV-2 (JH-EPICS) is to define the immune responses that can either protect or harm during infection.

All clinical assessments were performed by a physician, with some (16%) conducted by a nurse practitioner or physician assistant in conjunction with physician supervision.	10.21430/M39YVOOYSV	N	Retrospective review of clinical records		Not Specified		2022-01-24 00:00:00.0	DR42	None	2022-01-24 00:00:00.0	DR42	90.0	40.0		Efficacy of clinical evaluations for COVID-19 on the front line	2022-01-24 00:00:00.0	Y	NCI, NIH OD, Other			mrbast_20210707_29294	PMID33160316	6661.0	2021-07-07 20:45:10.0	heschaefer	2022-08-14 18:37:22.0	heschaefer	4951.0	2021-12-01 17:07:01.0	Zhiping.gu	2021-12-01 17:07:01.0	Zhiping.gu	NIH	Our study will be centered on the ethnically/racially diverse population served by our health system in Los Angeles, given then critical need for more knowledge regarding the determinants of COVID-19 related risks in these minority subgroups.

10	SDY1810		1.0		Years	In this retrospective study, we characterised all patients with COVID-19 discharged home from Emergency Department in our US multisite healthcare system from March 2020 to August 2020, focusing on individuals who returned within 2 weeks and required hospital admission. Patients infected with COVID-19 may appear clinically safe for home convalescence. However, those with hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease and fever may in fact be only 'pseudo-safe' and are most at risk for subsequent hospitalisation with more severe illness and longer hospital stays.	Pseudo-safety in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 discharged home from the emergency department	N		2.0	N	Introduction: Emergency Departments (ED) are often the first line of contact with individuals infected with COVID-19 and play a key role in triage. However, there is currently little specific guidance for deciding when patients with COVID-19 require hospitalisation and when they may be safely observed as an outpatient. Methods: In this retrospective study, we characterised all patients with COVID-19 discharged home from EDs in our US multisite healthcare system from March 2020 to August 2020, focusing on individuals who returned within 2 weeks and required hospital admission. We restricted analyses to first-encounter data that do not depend on laboratory or imaging diagnostics in order to inform point-of-care assessments in resource-limited environments. Vitals and comorbidities were extracted from the electronic health record. We performed ordinal logistic regression analyses to identify predictors of inpatient admission, intensive care and intubation. Results: Of n=923 patients who were COVID-19 positive discharged from the ED, n=107 (11.6%) returned within 2 weeks and were admitted. In a multivariable-adjusted model including n=788 patients with complete risk factor information, history of hypertension increased odds of hospitalisation and severe illness by 1.92-fold (95% CI 1.07 to 3.41), diabetes by 2.20-fold (1.18 to 4.02), chronic lung disease by 2.21-fold (1.22 to 3.92) and fever by 2.89-fold (1.71 to 4.82). Having at least two of these risk factors increased the odds of future hospitalisation by 6.68-fold (3.54 to 12.70). Patients with hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease or fever had significantly longer hospital stays (median 5.92 days, 3.08-10.95 vs 3.21, 1.10-5.75, p<0.01) with numerically higher but not significantly different rates of intensive care unit admission (27.02% vs 14.30%, p=0.27) and intubation (12.16% vs 7.14%, p=0.71). Discussion: Patients infected with COVID-19 may appear clinically safe for home convalescence.

14	SDY1810		1.0		Years	In this retrospective study, we characterised all patients with COVID-19 discharged home from Emergency Department in our US multisite healthcare system from March 2020 to August 2020, focusing on individuals who returned within 2 weeks and required hospital admission. Patients infected with COVID-19 may appear clinically safe for home convalescence. However, those with hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease and fever may in fact be only 'pseudo-safe' and are most at risk for subsequent hospitalisation with more severe illness and longer hospital stays.	Pseudo-safety in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 discharged home from the emergency department	N		2.0	N	Introduction: Emergency Departments (ED) are often the first line of contact with individuals infected with COVID-19 and play a key role in triage. However, there is currently little specific guidance for deciding when patients with COVID-19 require hospitalisation and when they may be safely observed as an outpatient. Methods: In this retrospective study, we characterised all patients with COVID-19 discharged home from EDs in our US multisite healthcare system from March 2020 to August 2020, focusing on individuals who returned within 2 weeks and required hospital admission. We restricted analyses to first-encounter data that do not depend on laboratory or imaging diagnostics in order to inform point-of-care assessments in resource-limited environments. Vitals and comorbidities were extracted from the electronic health record. We performed ordinal logistic regression analyses to identify predictors of inpatient admission, intensive care and intubation. Results: Of n=923 patients who were COVID-19 positive discharged from the ED, n=107 (11.6%) returned within 2 weeks and were admitted. In a multivariable-adjusted model including n=788 patients with complete risk factor information, history of hypertension increased odds of hospitalisation and severe illness by 1.92-fold (95% CI 1.07 to 3.41), diabetes by 2.20-fold (1.18 to 4.02), chronic lung disease by 2.21-fold (1.22 to 3.92) and fever by 2.89-fold (1.71 to 4.82). Having at least two of these risk factors increased the odds of future hospitalisation by 6.68-fold (3.54 to 12.70). Patients with hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease or fever had significantly longer hospital stays (median 5.92 days, 3.08-10.95 vs 3.21, 1.10-5.75, p<0.01) with numerically higher but not significantly different rates of intensive care unit admission (27.02% vs 14.30%, p=0.27) and intubation (12.16% vs 7.14%, p=0.71).

However, those with hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease and fever may in fact be only 'pseudo-safe' and are most at risk for subsequent hospitalisation with more severe illness and longer hospital stays.	10.21430/M3OOUUIKO5	N	Retrospective review of clinical records		Other		2022-01-24 00:00:00.0	DR42	None	2022-01-24 00:00:00.0	DR42	89.0	0.0		Pseudo-safety in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 discharged home from the emergency department	2022-01-24 00:00:00.0	Y	NHLBI, NCI, other			mrbast_20210707_29297	PMID33602725	6661.0	2021-07-07 21:20:09.0	heschaefer	2022-08-14 18:37:40.0	heschaefer	4951.0	2021-12-01 17:07:01.0	Zhiping.gu	2021-12-01 17:07:01.0	Zhiping.gu	NIH	Our study will be centered on the ethnically/racially diverse population served by our health system in Los Angeles, given then critical need for more knowledge regarding the determinants of COVID-19 related risks in these minority subgroups.

We describe the dynamics of seroprevalence in an 'urgent care' group, which is enriched in cases of COVID-19 during the epidemic, and a 'routine care' group, which more closely represents the general population. Seroprevalence increased at different rates in both groups; seropositive samples were found as early as mid-February, and levelled out at slightly above 20% in both groups after the epidemic wave subsided by the end of May. From May to July, seroprevalence remained stable, suggesting lasting antibody levels in the population. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 was introduced in New York City earlier than previously documented and describe the dynamics of seroconversion over the full course of the first wave of the pandemic in a major metropolitan area.	10.21430/M3ZV06EAM0	N	ELISA, PCR		Other		2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	None	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	61.0	0.0		Repeated cross-sectional sero-monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	Y	NIAID, NCI, other			mrbast_20210717_29354	PMID33142304	6661.0	2021-07-17 13:15:07.0	mrbast	2022-06-17 00:35:42.0	heschaefer	4952.0	2021-12-01 17:35:44.0	Zhiping.gu	2021-12-01 17:35:44.0	Zhiping.gu	NIH	The overarching research theme for the Serological Center of Excellence at Mount Sinai, NY is to understand factors contributing to the vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with lung cancer through serological analysis of antibody response, and to characterize and compare the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with lung cancer compared to a matched “healthy” control group	2022-08-31 00:00:00.0	U54CA260560	https://reporter.nih.gov/search/a5-TZyPvtEmmNzk75UarxA/project-details/10222305	Vulnerability of SARS- CoV-2 Infection in Lung Cancer Based on Serological Antibody Analyses	100.0	2020-09-30 00:00:00.0	2021-11-30 10:33:47.0	Zhiping.gu	2021-12-03 16:29:21.0	Zhiping.gu	NIH	NCI Serological Sciences Network for COVID-19 (SeroNet)		https://frederick.cancer.gov/seronet, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-20-038.html, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-20-039.html	SeroNet	2020-09-30 00:00:00.0	2021-04-15 09:37:08.0	heschaefer	2021-04-15 09:44:07.0	heschaefer		File_1.xlsx~File_2.xlsx	COVID-19	COVID-19	mrbast_20210717_29354	2021-07-17 13:15:07.0	SYSTEM	2021-07-17 13:15:07.0	SYSTEM	PTL10518	mrbast_20210721_29440	2021-07-21 23:10:06.0	mrbast	2021-07-21 23:10:06.0	mrbast	Study protocol	PMID33142304_protocol_01.PTL10518.txt	PMID33142304_protocol_01	PMID33142304_protocol_01.txt	workspace/6661/protocol/PMID33142304_protocol_01.PTL10518.txt	Study Protocol	mrbast_20210721_29440	PMID33142304_protocol_01	6661	2021-07-21 23:10:06.0	mrbast	2021-07-21 23:10:06.0	mrbast

26	SDY1815		2.0		Years	We used the viral functional expansion of specific T cells (ViraFEST) platform to identify T cell responses crossreactive for the spike (S) glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and common cold coronaviruses (CCCs) at the T cell receptor (TCR) clonotype level in convalescent COVID-19 patients (CCPs) and SARS-CoV-2–unexposed donors. Memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes that crossrecognized the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and at least one other CCC were detected in 65% of CCPs and unexposed donors. Several of these TCRs were shared among multiple donors. Crossreactive T cells demonstrated significantly impaired SARS-CoV-2–specific proliferation in vitro relative to monospecific CD4+ T cells, which was consistent with lower functional avidity of their TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 relative to CCC.	Functional characterization of CD4+ T cell receptors crossreactive for SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses	N		2.0	N	Recent studies have reported T cell immunity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in unexposed donors, possibly due to crossrecognition by T cells specific for common cold coronaviruses (CCCs). True T cell crossreactivity, defined as the recognition by a single TCR of more than one distinct peptide-MHC ligand, has never been shown in the context of SARS-CoV-2.METHODS: We used the viral functional expansion of specific T cells (ViraFEST) platform to identify T cell responses crossreactive for the spike (S) glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs at the T cell receptor (TCR) clonotype level in convalescent COVID-19 patients (CCPs) and SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2/CCC crossreactivity and assessments of functional avidity were performed using a TCR cloning and transfection system.RESULTS: Memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes that crossrecognized the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and at least one other CCC were detected in 65% of CCPs and unexposed donors. Several of these TCRs were shared among multiple donors. Crossreactive T cells demonstrated significantly impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific proliferation in vitro relative to monospecific CD4+ T cells, which was consistent with lower functional avidity of their TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 relative to CCC.CONCLUSIONSOur data confirm, for what we believe is the first time, the existence of unique memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes crossrecognizing SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs. The lower avidity of crossreactive TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 may be the result of antigenic imprinting, such that preexisting CCC-specific memory T cells have reduced expansive capacity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to determine how these crossreactive T cell responses affect clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.	10.21430/M3C1CZ1MF2	N	TCR-Seq of DNA extracted from cultured CD4+ T cells, Deep TCR sequencing of DNA, Flow cytometry, DJ sequencing, TCR-Seq of DNA, intracellular staining, cel culture, generation of Jurkat reporter cell line and TCR transfer, epitope identification.

Crossreactive T cells demonstrated significantly impaired SARS-CoV-2–specific proliferation in vitro relative to monospecific CD4+ T cells, which was consistent with lower functional avidity of their TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 relative to CCC.	Functional characterization of CD4+ T cell receptors crossreactive for SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses	N		2.0	N	Recent studies have reported T cell immunity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in unexposed donors, possibly due to crossrecognition by T cells specific for common cold coronaviruses (CCCs). True T cell crossreactivity, defined as the recognition by a single TCR of more than one distinct peptide-MHC ligand, has never been shown in the context of SARS-CoV-2.METHODS: We used the viral functional expansion of specific T cells (ViraFEST) platform to identify T cell responses crossreactive for the spike (S) glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs at the T cell receptor (TCR) clonotype level in convalescent COVID-19 patients (CCPs) and SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2/CCC crossreactivity and assessments of functional avidity were performed using a TCR cloning and transfection system.RESULTS: Memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes that crossrecognized the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and at least one other CCC were detected in 65% of CCPs and unexposed donors. Several of these TCRs were shared among multiple donors. Crossreactive T cells demonstrated significantly impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific proliferation in vitro relative to monospecific CD4+ T cells, which was consistent with lower functional avidity of their TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 relative to CCC.CONCLUSIONSOur data confirm, for what we believe is the first time, the existence of unique memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes crossrecognizing SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs. The lower avidity of crossreactive TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 may be the result of antigenic imprinting, such that preexisting CCC-specific memory T cells have reduced expansive capacity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to determine how these crossreactive T cell responses affect clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.	10.21430/M3C1CZ1MF2	N	TCR-Seq of DNA extracted from cultured CD4+ T cells, Deep TCR sequencing of DNA, Flow cytometry, DJ sequencing, TCR-Seq of DNA, intracellular staining, cel culture, generation of Jurkat reporter cell line and TCR transfer, epitope identification.

32	SDY1819		4.0		Years	For SARS-CoV-2, specific monitoring of actively replicating virus is critical for investigating the protective and therapeutic efficacy of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antiviral drugs. We adapted a SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) RT-PCR assay to differentiate productive infection from inactivated or neutralized virus. Subgenomic RNAs are generated after cell entry and are poorly incorporated into mature virions, and thus may provide a marker for actively replicating virus. We show envelope (E) sgRNA was degraded by RNase in infected cell lysates, while genomic RNA (gRNA) was protected, presumably due to packaging into virions. To investigate the capacity of the sgRNA assay to distinguish input challenge virus from actively replicating virus in vivo, we compared the E sgRNA assay to a standard nucleoprotein (N) or E total (both gRNA and sgRNA) RNA in convalescent rhesus macaques and in antibody-treated rhesus macaques after experimental SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In both studies, the E sgRNA assay was negative, suggesting protective efficacy, whereas the N and E total RNA assays remained positive. These data suggest the potential utility of sgRNA to monitor actively replicating virus in prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 studies.	Comparison of Subgenomic and Total RNA in SARS-CoV-2 Challenged Rhesus Macaques	N		2.0	N	Respiratory virus challenge studies involve administration of the challenge virus and sampling to assess for protection in the same anatomical locations.

33	SDY1819		4.0		Years	For SARS-CoV-2, specific monitoring of actively replicating virus is critical for investigating the protective and therapeutic efficacy of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antiviral drugs. We adapted a SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) RT-PCR assay to differentiate productive infection from inactivated or neutralized virus. Subgenomic RNAs are generated after cell entry and are poorly incorporated into mature virions, and thus may provide a marker for actively replicating virus. We show envelope (E) sgRNA was degraded by RNase in infected cell lysates, while genomic RNA (gRNA) was protected, presumably due to packaging into virions. To investigate the capacity of the sgRNA assay to distinguish input challenge virus from actively replicating virus in vivo, we compared the E sgRNA assay to a standard nucleoprotein (N) or E total (both gRNA and sgRNA) RNA in convalescent rhesus macaques and in antibody-treated rhesus macaques after experimental SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In both studies, the E sgRNA assay was negative, suggesting protective efficacy, whereas the N and E total RNA assays remained positive. These data suggest the potential utility of sgRNA to monitor actively replicating virus in prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 studies.

By screening 16 putative sensors involved in sensing of RNA virus infection, we found that MDA5 and LGP2 primarily regulate IFN induction in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further analyses revealed that viral intermediates specifically activate the IFN response through MDA5-mediated sensing. Additionally, we find that IRF3, IRF5, and NF-B/p65 are the key transcription factors regulating the IFN response during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Cells with such features were largely absent in SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells from both COVID-19 patients and healthy controls non-exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our single-cell analysis revealed substantial diversity in the nature of CD8+ T cells responding to SARS-CoV-2.	Severely ill COVID-19 patients display impaired exhaustion features in SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells	N		2.0	N	The molecular properties of CD8+ T cells that respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection are not fully known. Here, we report on the single-cell transcriptomes of >80,000 virus-reactive CD8+ T cells, obtained using a modified Antigen-Reactive T cell Enrichment (ARTE) assay, from 39 COVID-19 patients and 10 healthy subjects. COVID-19 patients segregated into two groups based on whether the dominant CD8+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 was 'exhausted' or not. SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the exhausted subset were increased in frequency and displayed lesser cytotoxicity and inflammatory features in COVID-19 patients with mild compared to severe illness. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the dominant non-exhausted subset from patients with severe disease showed enrichment of transcripts linked to co-stimulation, pro-survival NF-KappaB signaling, and anti-apoptotic pathways, suggesting the generation of robust CD8+ T cell memory responses in patients with severe COVID-19 illness. CD8+ T cells reactive to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus from healthy subjects displayed polyfunctional features and enhanced glycolysis. Cells with such features were largely absent in SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells from both COVID-19 patients and healthy controls non-exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

There seems to be no clear path as to when this pandemic will end, as vaccines and new therapeutics may take several months or years to come to fruition. Despite the importance of tissue-resident memory T cells in the control of viral infections and providing immunity against future infection, we do not know if SARS-CoV-2 infection generates TRM responses at the sites of infection. Here, we will employ cutting-edge single-cell RNA-seq assays to characterize properties of SARS-CoV-2 reactive TRM cells in airway/lung and tumor tissues from cancer and non-cancer patients with or without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.	2022-08-31 00:00:00.0	U01CA260588	https://reporter.nih.gov/search/a5-TZyPvtEmmNzk75UarxA/project-details/10222422	SARS-CoV-2-reactive tissue-resident memory T cells in healthy and cancer subjects	100.0	2020-09-30 00:00:00.0	2021-11-19 17:18:01.0	Zhiping.gu	2021-12-01 17:53:04.0	Zhiping.gu	NIH	NCI Serological Sciences Network for COVID-19 (SeroNet)		https://frederick.cancer.gov/seronet, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-20-038.html, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-20-039.html	SeroNet	2020-09-30 00:00:00.0	2021-04-15 09:37:08.0	heschaefer	2021-04-15 09:44:07.0	heschaefer		abe4782_sm.docx~abe4782_table_s1-2_v2.xlsx~abe4782_table_s2.xlsx~abe4782_table_s3_v2.xlsx~abe4782_table_s4.xlsx~abe4782_table_s5_v2.xlsx~abe4782_table_s6_v2.xlsx~abe4782_table_s7_v2.xlsx~abe4782_table_s8.xlsx~abe4782_table_s9.xlsx~abe4782_table_s10.xlsx~abe4782_table_s11.xlsx	SARS-CoV-2	SARS-CoV-2	heschaefer_20220817_33743	2022-08-17 20:13:02.0	heschaefer	2022-08-18 00:45:00.0	heschaefer	PTL10527	mrbast_20210727_29508	2021-07-27 10:20:10.0	mrbast	2021-07-27 10:20:10.0	mrbast	Study Protocol	PMID33478949_protocol-01.PTL10527.txt	PMID33478949_protocol-01	PMID33478949_protocol-01.txt	workspace/6661/protocol/PMID33478949_protocol-01.PTL10527.txt	Study Protocol	mrbast_20210727_29508	PMID33478949_protocol-01	6661	2021-07-27 10:20:06.0	mrbast	2021-07-27 10:20:06.0	mrbast
38	SDY1831		5.0		Years	A serological analysis of 536 convalescent healthcare workers reveals that SARS-CoV-2-specific and virus-neutralizing antibody levels are elevated in individuals that experience severe disease. The severity-associated increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody is dominated by immunoglobulin G (IgG), with an IgG subclass ratio skewed toward elevated receptor binding domain (RBD)- and S1-specific IgG3. In addition, individuals that experience severe disease show elevated SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody binding to the inflammatory receptor Fc-Gamma RIIIa. Based on these correlational studies, we propose that spike-specific IgG subclass utilization may contribute to COVID-19 disease severity through potent Fc-mediated effector functions. These results may have significant implications for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design and convalescent plasma therapy.

Our findings thus provide evidence of immunological imprinting by previous seasonal coronavirus infections that can potentially modulate the antibody profile to SARS-CoV-2 infection.	10.21430/M3EMGZH7G6	N	Aged, Antibodies, Viral blood, Antibodies, Viral immunology, Antibody Formation, COVID-19 blood, COVID-19 immunology, COVID-19 transmission, COVID-19 virology, Cross Reactions, Female, Humans, Male, SARS-CoV-2 immunology, SARS-CoV-2 isolation and purification, SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus immunology		Not Specified, Other		2022-03-21 00:00:00.0	DR43	None	2022-03-21 00:00:00.0	DR43	89.0	0.0		Immunological imprinting of the antibody response in COVID-19 patients	2022-03-21 00:00:00.0	Y	Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai			mrbast_20210727_29511	PMID34145263	6661.0	2021-07-27 14:40:08.0	mrbast	2022-05-26 16:33:56.0	revepa	4952.0	2021-12-01 17:35:44.0	Zhiping.gu	2021-12-01 17:35:44.0	Zhiping.gu	NIH	The overarching research theme for the Serological Center of Excellence at Mount Sinai, NY is to understand factors contributing to the vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with lung cancer through serological analysis of antibody response, and to characterize and compare the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with lung cancer compared to a matched “healthy” control group	2022-08-31 00:00:00.0	U54CA260560	https://reporter.nih.gov/search/a5-TZyPvtEmmNzk75UarxA/project-details/10222305	Vulnerability of SARS- CoV-2 Infection in Lung Cancer Based on Serological Antibody Analyses	100.0	2020-09-30 00:00:00.0	2021-11-30 10:33:47.0	Zhiping.gu	2021-12-03 16:29:21.0	Zhiping.gu	NIH	NCI Serological Sciences Network for COVID-19 (SeroNet)		https://frederick.cancer.gov/seronet, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-20-038.html, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-20-039.html	SeroNet	2020-09-30 00:00:00.0	2021-04-15 09:37:08.0	heschaefer	2021-04-15 09:44:07.0	heschaefer		data-dictionary.txt~Source Data.xlsx	SARS-CoV-2	SARS-CoV-2	heschaefer_20220817_33769	2022-08-17 20:38:00.0	heschaefer	2022-08-18 00:45:00.0	heschaefer	PTL10530	mrbast_20210727_29511	2021-07-27 14:40:08.0	mrbast	2021-07-27 14:40:08.0	mrbast	Study Protocol	PMID34145263_protocol-01.PTL10530.txt	PMID34145263_protocol-01	PMID34145263_protocol-01.txt	workspace/6661/protocol/PMID34145263_protocol-01.PTL10530.txt	Study Protocol	mrbast_20210727_29511	PMID34145263_protocol-01	6661	2021-07-27 14:40:06.0	mrbast	2021-07-27 14:40:06.0	mrbast
42	SDY1835		3.0		Years	Ninety-five symptomatic outpatients self-collected midturbinate nasal, oropharyngeal (OP), and gingival crevicular fluid (oral fluid) samples at home and in a research clinic a median of 6 times over 1-3 months. Samples were tested for viral RNA, virus culture, and SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronavirus antibodies, and associations were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Sixteen nasal-OP samples collected 2-11 days post-symptom onset were virus culture positive out of 183 RT-PCR-positive samples tested. All participants but 1 with positive virus culture were negative for concomitant oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The mean time to first antibody detection in oral fluid was 8-13 days post-symptom onset. We demonstrate that delayed rise of oral fluid SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, elevated BMI, and absence of early fever are independently associated with delayed URT viral RNA clearance.	Delayed Rise of Oral Fluid Antibodies, Elevated BMI, and Absence of Early Fever Correlate With Longer Time to SARS-CoV-2 RNA Clearance in a Longitudinally Sampled Cohort of COVID-19 Outpatients	N		2.0	N	Sustained molecular detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in the upper respiratory tract (URT) in mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common. We sought to identify host and immune determinants of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Methods : Ninety-five symptomatic outpatients self-collected midturbinate nasal, oropharyngeal (OP), and gingival crevicular fluid (oral fluid) samples at home and in a research clinic a median of 6 times over 1-3 months. Samples were tested for viral RNA, virus culture, and SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronavirus antibodies, and associations were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results : Viral RNA clearance, as measured by SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in 507 URT samples occurred a median (interquartile range) 33.5 (17-63.5) days post-symptom onset. Sixteen nasal-OP samples collected 2-11 days post-symptom onset were virus culture positive out of 183 RT-PCR-positive samples tested. All participants but 1 with positive virus culture were negative for concomitant oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The mean time to first antibody detection in oral fluid was 8-13 days post-symptom onset. A longer time to first detection of oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99; P = .020) and body mass index (BMI) >=25 kg/m2 (aHR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18-0.78; P = .009) were independently associated with a longer time to SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA clearance. Fever as 1 of first 3 COVID-19 symptoms correlated with shorter time to viral RNA clearance (aHR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.02-4.18; P = .044).

Tissue-based SARS-CoV-2 detection in fatal COVID-19 infections: Sustained direct viral-induced damage is not necessary to drive disease progression	N		2.0	N	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although viral infection is known to trigger inflammatory processes contributing to tissue injury and organ failure, it is unclear whether direct viral damage is needed to sustain cellular injury. An understanding of pathogenic mechanisms has been handicapped by the absence of optimized methods to visualize the presence and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in damaged tissues. We first developed a positive control cell line (Vero E6) to validate SARS-CoV-2 detection assays. We then evaluated multiple organs (lungs, kidneys, heart, liver, brain, intestines, lymph nodes, and spleen) from fourteen COVID-19 autopsy cases using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the spike and the nucleoprotein proteins, and RNA in situ hybridization (RNA ISH) for the spike protein mRNA. Tissue detection assays were compared with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based detection. SARS-CoV-2 was histologically detected in the Vero E6 positive cell line control, 1 of 14 (7%) lungs, and none (0%) of the other 59 organs. There was perfect concordance between the IHC and RNA ISH results. qPCR confirmed high viral load in the SARS-CoV-2 ISH-positive lung tissue, and absent or low viral load in all ISH-negative tissues. In patients who die of COVID-19-related organ failure, SARS-CoV-2 is largely not detectable using tissue-based assays. Even in lungs showing widespread injury, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA or proteins were detected in only a small minority of cases. This observation supports the concept that viral infection is primarily a trigger for multiple-organ pathogenic proinflammatory responses.

We then evaluated multiple organs (lungs, kidneys, heart, liver, brain, intestines, lymph nodes, and spleen) from fourteen COVID-19 autopsy cases using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the spike and the nucleoprotein proteins, and RNA in situ hybridization (RNA ISH) for the spike protein mRNA. qPCR confirmed high viral load in the SARS-CoV-2 ISH-positive lung tissue, and absent or low viral load in all ISH-negative tissues.

Tissue-based SARS-CoV-2 detection in fatal COVID-19 infections: Sustained direct viral-induced damage is not necessary to drive disease progression	N		2.0	N	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although viral infection is known to trigger inflammatory processes contributing to tissue injury and organ failure, it is unclear whether direct viral damage is needed to sustain cellular injury. An understanding of pathogenic mechanisms has been handicapped by the absence of optimized methods to visualize the presence and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in damaged tissues. We first developed a positive control cell line (Vero E6) to validate SARS-CoV-2 detection assays. We then evaluated multiple organs (lungs, kidneys, heart, liver, brain, intestines, lymph nodes, and spleen) from fourteen COVID-19 autopsy cases using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the spike and the nucleoprotein proteins, and RNA in situ hybridization (RNA ISH) for the spike protein mRNA. Tissue detection assays were compared with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based detection. SARS-CoV-2 was histologically detected in the Vero E6 positive cell line control, 1 of 14 (7%) lungs, and none (0%) of the other 59 organs. There was perfect concordance between the IHC and RNA ISH results. qPCR confirmed high viral load in the SARS-CoV-2 ISH-positive lung tissue, and absent or low viral load in all ISH-negative tissues.

We then evaluated multiple organs (lungs, kidneys, heart, liver, brain, intestines, lymph nodes, and spleen) from fourteen COVID-19 autopsy cases using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the spike and the nucleoprotein proteins, and RNA in situ hybridization (RNA ISH) for the spike protein mRNA. qPCR confirmed high viral load in the SARS-CoV-2 ISH-positive lung tissue, and absent or low viral load in all ISH-negative tissues. In patients who die of COVID-19-related organ failure, SARS-CoV-2 is largely not detectable using tissue-based assays. Even in lungs showing widespread injury, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA or proteins were detected in only a small minority of cases.	Tissue-based SARS-CoV-2 detection in fatal COVID-19 infections: Sustained direct viral-induced damage is not necessary to drive disease progression	N		2.0	N	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although viral infection is known to trigger inflammatory processes contributing to tissue injury and organ failure, it is unclear whether direct viral damage is needed to sustain cellular injury. An understanding of pathogenic mechanisms has been handicapped by the absence of optimized methods to visualize the presence and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in damaged tissues. We first developed a positive control cell line (Vero E6) to validate SARS-CoV-2 detection assays. We then evaluated multiple organs (lungs, kidneys, heart, liver, brain, intestines, lymph nodes, and spleen) from fourteen COVID-19 autopsy cases using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the spike and the nucleoprotein proteins, and RNA in situ hybridization (RNA ISH) for the spike protein mRNA. Tissue detection assays were compared with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based detection. SARS-CoV-2 was histologically detected in the Vero E6 positive cell line control, 1 of 14 (7%) lungs, and none (0%) of the other 59 organs. There was perfect concordance between the IHC and RNA ISH results. qPCR confirmed high viral load in the SARS-CoV-2 ISH-positive lung tissue, and absent or low viral load in all ISH-negative tissues. In patients who die of COVID-19-related organ failure, SARS-CoV-2 is largely not detectable using tissue-based assays. Even in lungs showing widespread injury, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA or proteins were detected in only a small minority of cases. This observation supports the concept that viral infection is primarily a trigger for multiple-organ pathogenic proinflammatory responses.

Even in lungs showing widespread injury, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA or proteins were detected in only a small minority of cases.	Tissue-based SARS-CoV-2 detection in fatal COVID-19 infections: Sustained direct viral-induced damage is not necessary to drive disease progression	N		2.0	N	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although viral infection is known to trigger inflammatory processes contributing to tissue injury and organ failure, it is unclear whether direct viral damage is needed to sustain cellular injury. An understanding of pathogenic mechanisms has been handicapped by the absence of optimized methods to visualize the presence and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in damaged tissues. We first developed a positive control cell line (Vero E6) to validate SARS-CoV-2 detection assays. We then evaluated multiple organs (lungs, kidneys, heart, liver, brain, intestines, lymph nodes, and spleen) from fourteen COVID-19 autopsy cases using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the spike and the nucleoprotein proteins, and RNA in situ hybridization (RNA ISH) for the spike protein mRNA. Tissue detection assays were compared with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based detection. SARS-CoV-2 was histologically detected in the Vero E6 positive cell line control, 1 of 14 (7%) lungs, and none (0%) of the other 59 organs. There was perfect concordance between the IHC and RNA ISH results. qPCR confirmed high viral load in the SARS-CoV-2 ISH-positive lung tissue, and absent or low viral load in all ISH-negative tissues. In patients who die of COVID-19-related organ failure, SARS-CoV-2 is largely not detectable using tissue-based assays. Even in lungs showing widespread injury, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA or proteins were detected in only a small minority of cases. This observation supports the concept that viral infection is primarily a trigger for multiple-organ pathogenic proinflammatory responses. Direct viral tissue damage is a transient phenomenon that is generally not sustained throughout disease progression.	10.21430/M3IDUI9TUU	N	Immunohistochemistry, RNA in-situ hybridization, PCR		Not Specified, Other		2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	None	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	94.0	32.0		Tissue-based SARS-CoV-2 detection in fatal COVID-19 infections: Sustained direct viral-induced damage is not necessary to drive disease progression	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	Y	NIAID, NCI, NIH, other			mrbast_20210728_29523	PMID33961839	6661.0	2021-07-28 21:10:09.0	mrbast	2022-06-17 00:54:47.0	heschaefer	4952.0	2021-12-03 16:29:18.0	Zhiping.gu	2021-12-03 16:29:18.0	Zhiping.gu	NIH	The overarching research theme for the Serological Center of Excellence at Mount Sinai, NY is to understand factors contributing to the vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with lung cancer through serological analysis of antibody response, and to characterize and compare the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with lung cancer compared to a matched “healthy” control group	2022-08-31 00:00:00.0	U54CA260560	https://reporter.nih.gov/search/a5-TZyPvtEmmNzk75UarxA/project-details/10222305	Vulnerability of SARS- CoV-2 Infection in Lung Cancer Based on Serological Antibody Analyses	100.0	2020-09-30 00:00:00.0	2021-11-30 10:33:47.0	Zhiping.gu	2021-12-03 16:29:21.0	Zhiping.gu	NIH	NCI Serological Sciences Network for COVID-19 (SeroNet)		https://frederick.cancer.gov/seronet, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-20-038.html, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-20-039.html	SeroNet	2020-09-30 00:00:00.0	2021-04-15 09:37:08.0	heschaefer	2021-04-15 09:44:07.0	heschaefer			Parkinson's disease	Parkinson's disease	heschaefer_20220814_33641	2022-08-14 20:29:43.0	SYSTEM	2022-08-14 20:29:43.0	SYSTEM	PTL10538	mrbast_20210728_29523	2021-07-28 21:10:09.0	mrbast	2021-07-28 21:10:09.0	mrbast	Study Protocol	PMID33961839_protocol-01.PTL10538.txt	PMID33961839_protocol-01	PMID33961839_protocol-01.txt	workspace/6661/protocol/PMID33961839_protocol-01.PTL10538.txt	Study Protocol	mrbast_20210728_29523	PMID33961839_protocol-01	6661	2021-07-28 21:10:06.0	mrbast	2021-07-28 21:10:06.0	mrbast

Direct viral tissue damage is a transient phenomenon that is generally not sustained throughout disease progression.	10.21430/M3IDUI9TUU	N	Immunohistochemistry, RNA in-situ hybridization, PCR		Not Specified, Other		2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	None	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	94.0	32.0		Tissue-based SARS-CoV-2 detection in fatal COVID-19 infections: Sustained direct viral-induced damage is not necessary to drive disease progression	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	Y	NIAID, NCI, NIH, other			mrbast_20210728_29523	PMID33961839	6661.0	2021-07-28 21:10:09.0	mrbast	2022-06-17 00:54:47.0	heschaefer	4952.0	2021-12-03 16:29:18.0	Zhiping.gu	2021-12-03 16:29:18.0	Zhiping.gu	NIH	The overarching research theme for the Serological Center of Excellence at Mount Sinai, NY is to understand factors contributing to the vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with lung cancer through serological analysis of antibody response, and to characterize and compare the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with lung cancer compared to a matched “healthy” control group	2022-08-31 00:00:00.0	U54CA260560	https://reporter.nih.gov/search/a5-TZyPvtEmmNzk75UarxA/project-details/10222305	Vulnerability of SARS- CoV-2 Infection in Lung Cancer Based on Serological Antibody Analyses	100.0	2020-09-30 00:00:00.0	2021-11-30 10:33:47.0	Zhiping.gu	2021-12-03 16:29:21.0	Zhiping.gu	NIH	NCI Serological Sciences Network for COVID-19 (SeroNet)		https://frederick.cancer.gov/seronet, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-20-038.html, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-20-039.html	SeroNet	2020-09-30 00:00:00.0	2021-04-15 09:37:08.0	heschaefer	2021-04-15 09:44:07.0	heschaefer			SARS-CoV-2	SARS-CoV-2	heschaefer_20220817_33738	2022-08-17 20:08:01.0	heschaefer	2022-08-18 00:45:00.0	heschaefer	PTL10538	mrbast_20210728_29523	2021-07-28 21:10:09.0	mrbast	2021-07-28 21:10:09.0	mrbast	Study Protocol	PMID33961839_protocol-01.PTL10538.txt	PMID33961839_protocol-01	PMID33961839_protocol-01.txt	workspace/6661/protocol/PMID33961839_protocol-01.PTL10538.txt	Study Protocol	mrbast_20210728_29523	PMID33961839_protocol-01	6661	2021-07-28 21:10:06.0	mrbast	2021-07-28 21:10:06.0	mrbast

Estimating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and epidemiological parameters with uncertainty from serological surveys	N		2.0	N	Establishing how many people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 remains an urgent priority for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Serological tests that identify past infection can be used to estimate cumulative incidence, but the relative accuracy and robustness of various sampling strategies have been unclear. We developed a flexible framework that integrates uncertainty from test characteristics, sample size, and heterogeneity in seroprevalence across subpopulations to compare estimates from sampling schemes. Using the same framework and making the assumption that seropositivity indicates immune protection, we propagated estimates and uncertainty through dynamical models to assess uncertainty in the epidemiological parameters needed to evaluate public health interventions and found that sampling schemes informed by demographics and contact networks outperform uniform sampling. The framework can be adapted to optimize serosurvey design given test characteristics and capacity, population demography, sampling strategy, and modeling approach, and can be tailored to support decision-making around introducing or removing interventions.	10.21430/M3M73PFN8O	N	Adolescent, Adult, Age Factors, Aged, Bayes Theorem, Child, Child, Preschool, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Middle Aged, Pandemics, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, antibody, epidemiology, global health, infectious disease, microbiology, modeling, serology, uncertainty		Not Specified		2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	None	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	89.0	0.0		Estimating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and epidemiological parameters with uncertainty from serological surveys	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	Y	NCI, other			mrbast_20210809_29632	PMID33666169	6661.0	2021-08-09 11:35:16.0	mrbast	2022-06-17 00:57:51.0	heschaefer	4957.0	2021-12-01 17:42:04.0	Zhiping.gu	2021-12-01 17:42:04.0	Zhiping.gu	NIH	We will develop methods to enhance the design and analysis of serologic studies of populations with respect to COVID-19, including methods that may be generalized in the future to address challenges raised by other seasonal diseases (such as influenza) and newly emerging diseases.

We describe an approach to estimate these vaccines' effects on viral positivity, a prevalence measure which under the reasonable assumption that vaccinated individuals who become infected are no more infectious than unvaccinated individuals forms a lower bound on efficacy against transmission. Specifically, we recommend separate analysis of positive tests triggered by symptoms (usually the primary RCT outcome) and cross-sectional prevalence of positive tests obtained regardless of symptoms. The odds ratio of carriage for vaccine vs. placebo provides an unbiased estimate of vaccine effectiveness against viral positivity, under certain assumptions, and we show through simulations that likely departures from these assumptions will only modestly bias this estimate.

Across all models, the burden of infection fell disproportionately on minority populations: in a model fit to Long Island serosurvey and census data, 81% of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT was reached compared to 34% of non-Hispanic whites. Our findings, which are meant to be illustrative and not best estimates, demonstrate how racial and ethnic disparities can impact epidemic trajectories and result in unequal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infection.	Modeling the impact of racial and ethnic disparities on COVID-19 epidemic dynamics	N		2.0	N	Background: The impact of variable infection risk by race and ethnicity on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread is largely unknown. Methods: Here, we fit structured compartmental models to seroprevalence data from New York State and analyze how herd immunity thresholds (HITs), final sizes, and epidemic risk change across groups. Results: A simple model where interactions occur proportionally to contact rates reduced the HIT, but more realistic models of preferential mixing within groups increased the threshold toward the value observed in homogeneous populations. Across all models, the burden of infection fell disproportionately on minority populations: in a model fit to Long Island serosurvey and census data, 81% of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT was reached compared to 34% of non-Hispanic whites. Conclusions: Our findings, which are meant to be illustrative and not best estimates, demonstrate how racial and ethnic disparities can impact epidemic trajectories and result in unequal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In Dec 2019, a third novel CoV designated SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan China and has caused over 13 million cases, >570,000 deaths in >220 countries. In the expanding US epidemic, SARS- CoV2 has caused >137,000 deaths and significantly more severe infections characterized by pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coagulopathies, and inflammatory disorders. Incredibly, careful analyses of zoonotic bat CoV has revealed the presence of numerous group 2b SARS-like, group 2c MERS-like and remarkably, group 1 strains that replicate efficiently in primary human airway or gut enteroid cultures. To prepare for future CoV calamities, defined diagnostic assays and serologic investigations are essential for tracking current and future outbreaks and evaluate type specific and broad serologic immunity associated with population immunity. The goal of this U54 Center Program is to develop novel type- and group-specific serologic and neutralization assays (Project 1-Baric, Project 2-, Core B and C) designed to characterize the serological repertoire and to identify key domain-specific mucosal and systemic neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection. One key underlying hypothesis is that IgA and IgG repertoires are different across mucosal and systemic compartments and target unique and overlapping epitope domains in the SARS-CoV2 S glycoprotein. Another underlying hypothesis is that intervention strategies can altered the memory B cell and antibody repertoires in mucosal and serologic compartments. Finally the program develops novel mouse models of human disease designed to mechanistically address fundamental immune innate and adaptive interactions associated with protective immunity. The Project uses novel technologies, basic and applied strategies to build a portfolio of reagents that map, track and treat SARS-CoV2 and other SARS-like group 2b CoV of the future. In Aim 1, we evaluate the kinetics, magnitude, durability of type specific neutralizing antibody responses after infection. Aim 2 characterizes the breadth of the mucosal and systemic serologic repertoires across Sarbecoviruses.

68	SDY1890		8.0		Years	Herein we provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through cell-cell contact in cultures, mediated by the spike glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 spike is more efficient in facilitating cell-to-cell transmission than SARS-CoV spike, which reflects, in part, their differential cell-cell fusion activity. Interestingly, treatment of cocultured cells with endosomal entry inhibitors impairs cell-to-cell transmission, implicating endosomal membrane fusion as an underlying mechanism. Compared with cell-free infection, cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is refractory to inhibition by neutralizing antibody or convalescent sera of COVID-19 patients. While ACE2 enhances cell-to-cell transmission, we find that it is not absolutely required. Notably, despite differences in cell-free infectivity, the variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 have similar cell-to-cell transmission capability. Moreover, B.1.351 is more resistant to neutralization by vaccinee sera in cell-free infection, whereas B.1.1.7 is more resistant to inhibition by vaccine sera in cell-to-cell transmission. Overall, our study reveals critical features of SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated cell-to-cell transmission, with important implications for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 spread and pathogenesis.

69	SDY1916		6.0		Years	We investigated whether neutrophil elastase regulates the adjuvanticity of alum, and whether a strategy targeting neutrophil elastase could improve responses to injected vaccines. Mice coadministered a pharmacological inhibitor of elastase, or lacking elastase, developed high-affinity serum IgG and IgA antibodies after immunization with alum-adsorbed protein vaccines, including the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). These mice also developed broader antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses, including high Th1 and T follicular helper (Tfh) responses. Interestingly, in the absence of elastase activity, mucosal SIgA responses were induced after systemic immunization with alum as adjuvant. Importantly, lack or suppression of elastase activity enhanced the magnitude of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit 1 (S1) antibodies, and these antibodies reacted with the same epitopes of spike 1 protein as sera from COVID-19 patients. Therefore, suppression of neutrophil elastase could represent an attractive strategy for improving the efficacy of alum-based injected vaccines for the induction of broad immunity, including mucosal immunity.

72	SDY1917		2.0		Years	In this study, we determined the neutralizing antibody response in 160 cancer patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lung cancer, breast cancer, and various non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), after they received two doses of mRNA vaccines. Serum from 46 mRNA vaccinated health care workers (HCWs) served as healthy controls. We discovered that (1) cancer patients exhibited reduced neutralizing antibody titer (NT50) compared to HCWs; (2) CLL and NHL patients exhibited the lowest NT50 levels, with 50-60% of them below the detection limit; (3) mean NT50 levels in patients with CLL and NHL was ~2.6 fold lower than those with solid tumors; and (4) cancer patients who received anti-B cell therapy exhibited significantly reduced NT50 levels. Our results demonstrate an urgent need for novel immunization strategies for cancer patients against SARS-CoV-2, particularly those with hematological cancers and those on anti-B cell therapies.

73	SDY1927		8.0		Years	In this study, a cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of Ab, soluble immune mediators, and transcriptional responses in young (< or = 65 years) and aged (>65 years) diabetic males with obesity hospitalized with acute severe COVID-19 was conducted. Additionally, the transcriptional profiles in samples obtained before and after corticosteroids became standard of care were compared. The analysis indicates that severe COVID-19 is characterized by robust Ab responses, heightened systemic inflammation, increased expression of genes related to inflammatory and pro-apoptotic processes, and reduced expression of those important for adaptive immunity regardless of age. In contrast, COVID-19 patients receiving steroids did not show high levels of systemic immune mediators and lacked transcriptional indicators of heightened inflammatory and apoptotic responses. Overall, these data suggest that inflammation and cell death are key drivers of severe COVID-19 pathogenesis in the absence of corticosteroid therapy.	Corticosteroid treatment in COVID-19 modulates host inflammatory responses and transcriptional signatures of immune dysregulation	N		2.0	N	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease that varies in severity from mild to severe/fatal. Several risk factors for severe disease have been identified, notably age, male sex, and pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Several advancements in clinical care have been achieved over the past year, including the use of corticosteroids (e.g., corticosteroids) and other immune-modulatory treatments that have now become standard of care for patients with acute severe COVID-19. While the understanding of the mechanisms that underlie increased disease severity with age has improved over the past few months, it remains incomplete. Furthermore, the molecular impact of corticosteroid treatment on host response to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been investigated.

77	SDY1927		8.0		Years	In this study, a cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of Ab, soluble immune mediators, and transcriptional responses in young (< or = 65 years) and aged (>65 years) diabetic males with obesity hospitalized with acute severe COVID-19 was conducted. Additionally, the transcriptional profiles in samples obtained before and after corticosteroids became standard of care were compared. The analysis indicates that severe COVID-19 is characterized by robust Ab responses, heightened systemic inflammation, increased expression of genes related to inflammatory and pro-apoptotic processes, and reduced expression of those important for adaptive immunity regardless of age. In contrast, COVID-19 patients receiving steroids did not show high levels of systemic immune mediators and lacked transcriptional indicators of heightened inflammatory and apoptotic responses. Overall, these data suggest that inflammation and cell death are key drivers of severe COVID-19 pathogenesis in the absence of corticosteroid therapy.	Corticosteroid treatment in COVID-19 modulates host inflammatory responses and transcriptional signatures of immune dysregulation	N		2.0	N	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease that varies in severity from mild to severe/fatal. Several risk factors for severe disease have been identified, notably age, male sex, and pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Several advancements in clinical care have been achieved over the past year, including the use of corticosteroids (e.g., corticosteroids) and other immune-modulatory treatments that have now become standard of care for patients with acute severe COVID-19. While the understanding of the mechanisms that underlie increased disease severity with age has improved over the past few months, it remains incomplete. Furthermore, the molecular impact of corticosteroid treatment on host response to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been investigated. In this study, a cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of Ab, soluble immune mediators, and transcriptional responses in young (< or = 65 years) and aged (> 65 years) diabetic males with obesity hospitalized with acute severe COVID-19 was conducted. Additionally, the transcriptional profiles in samples obtained before and after corticosteroids became standard of care were compared. The analysis indicates that severe COVID-19 is characterized by robust Ab responses, heightened systemic inflammation, increased expression of genes related to inflammatory and pro-apoptotic processes, and reduced expression of those important for adaptive immunity regardless of age.

78	SDY1932		3.0		Years	To characterize serological responses to coronaviruses in Sierra Leoneans, we tested blood samples collected before the reports in late 2019 of the first COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China. We demonstrate that, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of Sierra Leonians with cross-reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses was higher than in United States blood donors.	Cross-Reactive Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in Pre-COVID-19 Blood Samples from Sierra Leoneans	N		2.0	N	Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa have experienced lower COVID-19 caseloads and fewer deaths than countries in other regions worldwide. Under-reporting of cases and a younger population could partly account for these differences, but pre-existing immunity to coronaviruses is another potential factor. Blood samples from Sierra Leonean Lassa fever and Ebola survivors and their contacts collected before the first reported COVID-19 cases were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the presence of antibodies binding to proteins of coronaviruses that infect humans. Results were compared to COVID-19 subjects and healthy blood donors from the United States. Prior to the pandemic, Sierra Leoneans had more frequent exposures than Americans to coronaviruses with epitopes that cross-react with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The percentage of Sierra Leoneans with antibodies reacting to seasonal coronaviruses was also higher than for American blood donors. Serological responses to coronaviruses by Sierra Leoneans did not differ by age or sex. Approximately a quarter of Sierra Leonian pre-pandemic blood samples had neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, while about a third neutralized MERS-CoV pseudovirus.

84	SDY1947		3.0		Years	In this work, we report that in a subset of patients -despite a decline in total S-specific antibodies- neutralizing antibody titers remain at a similar level for an average of 98 days in longitudinal sampling of a cohort of 59 Hispanic/Latino patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Our data suggest that 100% of seroconverting patients make detectable neutralizing antibody responses which can be quantified by a surrogate viral neutralization test. Examination of sera from ten out of the 59 subjects which received mRNA-based vaccination revealed that both IgG titers and neutralizing activity of sera were higher after vaccination compared to a cohort of 21 SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects. One dose was sufficient for the induction of a neutralizing antibody, but two doses were necessary to reach 100% surrogate virus neutralization in subjects irrespective of previous SARS-CoV-2 natural infection status. Like the pattern observed after natural infection, the total anti-S antibodies titers declined after the second vaccine dose; however, neutralizing activity remained relatively constant for more than 80 days after the first vaccine dose. Furthermore, our data indicates that -compared with mRNA vaccination- natural infection induces a more robust humoral immune response in unexposed subjects. This work is an important contribution to understanding the natural immune response to the novel coronavirus in a population severely impacted by SARS-CoV-2.

86	SDY1962		4.0		Years	With a significantly lower incidence of post-vaccination reactions among NH residents as reported in this study, the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine appears to be well-tolerated among this vulnerable population. If validated in larger populations, absence of reactogenicity could help guide clinicians in prioritizing vaccine boosters. Reactogenicity is significantly mild among nursing home residents and overall, subjects who reported post-vaccination reactions developed higher antibody titers.	Does a lack of vaccine side effects correlate with reduced BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine response among healthcare workers and nursing home residents?	N		2.0	N	Background: The BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination has mitigated the burden of COVID-19 among residents of long-term care facilities considerably, despite being excluded from the vaccine trials. Data on reactogenicity (vaccine side effects) in this population are limited.Aims: To assess reactogenicity among nursing home (NH) residents. To provide a plausible proxy for predicting vaccine response among this population.Methods: We enrolled and sampled NH residents and community-dwelling healthcare workers who received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, to assess local or systemic reactogenicity and antibody levels (immunogenicity).Results: NH residents reported reactions at a much lower frequency and lesser severity than the community-dwelling healthcare workers. These reactions were mild and transient with all subjects experiencing more local than systemic reactions. Based on our reactogenicity and immunogenicity data, we developed a linear regression model predicting log-transformed anti-spike, anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD), and neutralizing titers, with a dichotomous variable indicating the presence or absence of reported reactions which revealed a statistically significant effect, with estimated shifts in log-transformed titers ranging from 0.32 to 0.37 (all p < 0.01) indicating greater immunogenicity in subjects with one or more reported reactions of varying severity.Discussion: With a significantly lower incidence of post-vaccination reactions among NH residents as reported in this study, the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine appears to be well-tolerated among this vulnerable population. If validated in larger populations, absence of reactogenicity could help guide clinicians in prioritizing vaccine boosters.Conclusions: Reactogenicity is significantly mild among nursing home residents and overall, subjects who reported post-vaccination reactions developed higher antibody titers.	10.21430/M3KRZ9GLCR	N	Immunogenicity, Nursing homes, Reactogenicity, Vaccination, BNT162 Vaccine, COVID-19 Vaccines, COVID-19, Health Personnel, Humans, RNA, Messenger, genetics		Other		2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 vaccine	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	90.0	26.0	Clinical Research	Does a lack of vaccine side effects correlate with reduced BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine response among healthcare workers and nursing home residents?	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	Y	Case Western Reserve University	193.0		aleliu_20220524_32503	PMID34652783_study-01	6661.0	2022-05-24 13:40:15.0	heschaefer	2022-08-16 02:35:00.0	heschaefer	4943.0	2022-06-15 22:19:28.0	heschaefer	2022-06-15 22:19:28.0	heschaefer	NIH	The study examines events associated with initial exposure to COVID-19 by following close household contacts of individuals with documented COVID-19 over a period of 28 days.

90	SDY1964		3.0		Years	Here we report the results of a head-to-head comparison of the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of CVnCoV and CV2CoV in non-human primates. We immunized 18 cynomolgus macaques with two doses of 12 μg lipid nanoparticle-formulated CVnCoV or CV2CoV or with sham (n = 6 per group). Compared with CVnCoV, CV2CoV induced substantially higher titres of binding and neutralizing antibodies, memory B cell responses and T cell responses as well as more potent neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the Delta variant. Moreover, CV2CoV was found to be comparably immunogenic to the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine in macaques. Although CVnCoV provided partial protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, CV2CoV afforded more robust protection with markedly lower viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Binding and neutralizing antibody titres were correlated with protective efficacy. These data demonstrate that optimization of non-coding regions can greatly improve the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a non-modified mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in non-human primates.

91	SDY1964		3.0		Years	Here we report the results of a head-to-head comparison of the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of CVnCoV and CV2CoV in non-human primates. We immunized 18 cynomolgus macaques with two doses of 12 μg lipid nanoparticle-formulated CVnCoV or CV2CoV or with sham (n = 6 per group). Compared with CVnCoV, CV2CoV induced substantially higher titres of binding and neutralizing antibodies, memory B cell responses and T cell responses as well as more potent neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the Delta variant. Moreover, CV2CoV was found to be comparably immunogenic to the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine in macaques. Although CVnCoV provided partial protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, CV2CoV afforded more robust protection with markedly lower viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tracts.

94	SDY1966		6.0		Years	Neutralizing antibodies with extended half-life and lacking Fc-mediated effector functions are efficient for pre-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHPs. These results support clinical development of ADM03820 for COVID-19 prevention	A combination of two human neutralizing antibodies prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in cynomolgus macaques	N		2.0	N	Background: Human monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments are promising for COVID-19 prevention or therapy. The pre-exposure prophylactic efficacy of neutralizing antibodies that are engineered with mutations to extend their persistence in human serum and the neutralizing antibody titer in serum required for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly characterized.Methods: The Fc region of two neutralizing mAbs (COV2-2130 and COV2-2381) targeting non-overlapping epitopes on the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was engineered to extend their persistence in humans and reduce interactions with Fc gamma receptors. We assessed protection by individual antibodies or a combination of the two antibodies (designated ADM03820) given prophylactically by an intravenous or intramuscular route in a non-human primate (NHP) model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Findings: Passive transfer of individual mAbs or ADM03820 conferred virological protection in the NHP respiratory tract in a dose-dependent manner, and ADM03820 potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in vitro. We defined a protective serum-neutralizing antibody titer and concentration in NHPs for passively transferred human antibodies that acted by direct viral neutralization.Conclusions: In summary, we demonstrate that neutralizing antibodies with extended half-life and lacking Fc-mediated effector functions are efficient for pre-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHPs. These results support clinical development of ADM03820 for COVID-19 prevention.	10.21430/M3G3GC8IIZ	N	Animals, Antibodies Monoclonal, Antibodies Neutralizing therapeutic use, COVID-19 prevention control, Humans, Macaca, SARS-CoV-2, Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus		Not Specified, Other		2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	Other	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	12.0	6.0	Basic Research	A combination of two human neutralizing antibodies prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in cynomolgus macaques	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	Y	Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center			aleliu_20220524_32524	PMID35132398_study-01	6661.0	2022-05-24 14:25:14.0	aleliu	2022-06-17 01:49:55.0	heschaefer	4962.0	2022-06-15 22:25:42.0	heschaefer	2022-06-15 22:25:42.0	heschaefer	NIH	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that was first isolated in Wuhan China in December, 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is now a pandemic and has caused more than 1.3 million confirmed cases and 72,000 deaths, with an estimated case fatality rate of 4%, with substantially higher death rates (~15%) in the elderly or immunocompromised. Virtually all countries and territories have reported cases, with major epidemics in China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Iran, and the United States. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be of zoonotic origin, most likely bats, and is about 75% identical to the original SARS-CoV. Most cases are spread by direct human-to- human transmission, with community transmission in asymptomatic individuals described. Currently, no countermeasures are licensed for human use. The development, characterization, and ultimately deployment of an antibody-based treatment against SARS-CoV-2 could prevent substantial morbidity and mortality, and possibly mitigate its epidemic spread. This interactive multi-PI proposal leverages complementary expertise in the Diamond, Crowe, and Baric laboratories to rapidly develop highly neutralizing and therapeutic human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 for immediate use in humans. To achieve this goal, we will generate and interrogate human mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 that are obtained from multiple convalescent subjects. We will identify potently neutralizing mAbs and optimize them for affinity by selecting naturally occurring somatic variants identified by repertoire sequencing and sibling analysis and Fc effector functions. Protective activity of top candidate coronavirus mAbs will be tested in newly-generated and optimized mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those expressing human ACE2 receptors (hACE2). To define correlates of protection, we will use chimeric viruses, shotgun mutagenesis, and neutralization escape to identify the epitopes of our most protective mAbs.

95	SDY1966		6.0		Years	Neutralizing antibodies with extended half-life and lacking Fc-mediated effector functions are efficient for pre-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHPs. These results support clinical development of ADM03820 for COVID-19 prevention	A combination of two human neutralizing antibodies prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in cynomolgus macaques	N		2.0	N	Background: Human monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments are promising for COVID-19 prevention or therapy. The pre-exposure prophylactic efficacy of neutralizing antibodies that are engineered with mutations to extend their persistence in human serum and the neutralizing antibody titer in serum required for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly characterized.Methods: The Fc region of two neutralizing mAbs (COV2-2130 and COV2-2381) targeting non-overlapping epitopes on the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was engineered to extend their persistence in humans and reduce interactions with Fc gamma receptors. We assessed protection by individual antibodies or a combination of the two antibodies (designated ADM03820) given prophylactically by an intravenous or intramuscular route in a non-human primate (NHP) model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Findings: Passive transfer of individual mAbs or ADM03820 conferred virological protection in the NHP respiratory tract in a dose-dependent manner, and ADM03820 potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in vitro. We defined a protective serum-neutralizing antibody titer and concentration in NHPs for passively transferred human antibodies that acted by direct viral neutralization.Conclusions: In summary, we demonstrate that neutralizing antibodies with extended half-life and lacking Fc-mediated effector functions are efficient for pre-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHPs.

SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is now a pandemic and has caused more than 1.3 million confirmed cases and 72,000 deaths, with an estimated case fatality rate of 4%, with substantially higher death rates (~15%) in the elderly or immunocompromised. Virtually all countries and territories have reported cases, with major epidemics in China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Iran, and the United States. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be of zoonotic origin, most likely bats, and is about 75% identical to the original SARS-CoV. Most cases are spread by direct human-to- human transmission, with community transmission in asymptomatic individuals described. Currently, no countermeasures are licensed for human use. The development, characterization, and ultimately deployment of an antibody-based treatment against SARS-CoV-2 could prevent substantial morbidity and mortality, and possibly mitigate its epidemic spread. This interactive multi-PI proposal leverages complementary expertise in the Diamond, Crowe, and Baric laboratories to rapidly develop highly neutralizing and therapeutic human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 for immediate use in humans. To achieve this goal, we will generate and interrogate human mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 that are obtained from multiple convalescent subjects. We will identify potently neutralizing mAbs and optimize them for affinity by selecting naturally occurring somatic variants identified by repertoire sequencing and sibling analysis and Fc effector functions. Protective activity of top candidate coronavirus mAbs will be tested in newly-generated and optimized mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those expressing human ACE2 receptors (hACE2). To define correlates of protection, we will use chimeric viruses, shotgun mutagenesis, and neutralization escape to identify the epitopes of our most protective mAbs. Our team has extensive experience in the generation, characterization and optimization of antibodies, CoV biology, and animal models of disease and protection.

99	SDY1966		6.0		Years	Neutralizing antibodies with extended half-life and lacking Fc-mediated effector functions are efficient for pre-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHPs. These results support clinical development of ADM03820 for COVID-19 prevention	A combination of two human neutralizing antibodies prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in cynomolgus macaques	N		2.0	N	Background: Human monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments are promising for COVID-19 prevention or therapy. The pre-exposure prophylactic efficacy of neutralizing antibodies that are engineered with mutations to extend their persistence in human serum and the neutralizing antibody titer in serum required for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly characterized.Methods: The Fc region of two neutralizing mAbs (COV2-2130 and COV2-2381) targeting non-overlapping epitopes on the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was engineered to extend their persistence in humans and reduce interactions with Fc gamma receptors. We assessed protection by individual antibodies or a combination of the two antibodies (designated ADM03820) given prophylactically by an intravenous or intramuscular route in a non-human primate (NHP) model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Findings: Passive transfer of individual mAbs or ADM03820 conferred virological protection in the NHP respiratory tract in a dose-dependent manner, and ADM03820 potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in vitro. We defined a protective serum-neutralizing antibody titer and concentration in NHPs for passively transferred human antibodies that acted by direct viral neutralization.Conclusions: In summary, we demonstrate that neutralizing antibodies with extended half-life and lacking Fc-mediated effector functions are efficient for pre-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHPs. These results support clinical development of ADM03820 for COVID-19 prevention.	10.21430/M3G3GC8IIZ	N	Animals, Antibodies Monoclonal, Antibodies Neutralizing therapeutic use, COVID-19 prevention control, Humans, Macaca, SARS-CoV-2, Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus		Not Specified, Other		2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	Other	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	12.0	6.0	Basic Research	A combination of two human neutralizing antibodies prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in cynomolgus macaques	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	Y	Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center			aleliu_20220524_32524	PMID35132398_study-01	6661.0	2022-05-24 14:25:14.0	aleliu	2022-06-17 01:49:55.0	heschaefer	4962.0	2022-06-15 22:25:42.0	heschaefer	2022-06-15 22:25:42.0	heschaefer	NIH	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that was first isolated in Wuhan China in December, 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is now a pandemic and has caused more than 1.3 million confirmed cases and 72,000 deaths, with an estimated case fatality rate of 4%, with substantially higher death rates (~15%) in the elderly or immunocompromised. Virtually all countries and territories have reported cases, with major epidemics in China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Iran, and the United States. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be of zoonotic origin, most likely bats, and is about 75% identical to the original SARS-CoV. Most cases are spread by direct human-to- human transmission, with community transmission in asymptomatic individuals described. Currently, no countermeasures are licensed for human use. The development, characterization, and ultimately deployment of an antibody-based treatment against SARS-CoV-2 could prevent substantial morbidity and mortality, and possibly mitigate its epidemic spread. This interactive multi-PI proposal leverages complementary expertise in the Diamond, Crowe, and Baric laboratories to rapidly develop highly neutralizing and therapeutic human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 for immediate use in humans. To achieve this goal, we will generate and interrogate human mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 that are obtained from multiple convalescent subjects. We will identify potently neutralizing mAbs and optimize them for affinity by selecting naturally occurring somatic variants identified by repertoire sequencing and sibling analysis and Fc effector functions. Protective activity of top candidate coronavirus mAbs will be tested in newly-generated and optimized mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those expressing human ACE2 receptors (hACE2). To define correlates of protection, we will use chimeric viruses, shotgun mutagenesis, and neutralization escape to identify the epitopes of our most protective mAbs. Our team has extensive experience in the generation, characterization and optimization of antibodies, CoV biology, and animal models of disease and protection. A therapy composed of one to three highly neutralizing mAbs may provide an immediate countermeasure against the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 and help establish correlates of structural and functional humoral protection that ultimately inform vaccine efforts.

Longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccine-Induced Humoral Immune Responses in Patients with Cancer	N		2.0	N	Longitudinal studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine-induced immune responses in patients with cancer are needed to optimize clinical care. In a prospective cohort study of 366 (291 vaccinated) patients, we measured antibody levels [anti-spike (IgG-(S-RBD) and anti-nucleocapsid immunoglobulin] at three time points. Antibody level trajectories and frequency of breakthrough infections were evaluated by tumor type and timing of treatment relative to vaccination. IgG-(S-RBD) at peak response (median = 42 days after dose 2) was higher (P = 0.002) and remained higher after 4 to 6 months (P = 0.003) in patients receiving mRNA-1273 compared with BNT162b2. Patients with solid tumors attained higher peak levels (P = 0.001) and sustained levels after 4 to 6 months (P < 0.001) compared with those with hematologic malignancies. B-cell targeted treatment reduced peak (P = 0.001) and sustained antibody responses (P = 0.003). Solid tumor patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors before vaccination had lower sustained antibody levels than those who received treatment after vaccination (P = 0.043). Two (0.69%) vaccinated and one (1.9%) unvaccinated patient had severe COVID-19 illness during follow-up. Our study shows variation in sustained antibody responses across cancer populations receiving various therapeutic modalities, with important implications for vaccine booster timing and patient selection.

103	SDY1969				Years	Encouraging staff vaccination is not only important for protecting staff, but might also reduce symptomatic cases in residents if a vaccine confers at least some protection against infection or infectiousness	Mathematical Modeling to Inform Vaccination Strategies and Testing Approaches for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Nursing Homes	N		2.0	N	Background: Nursing home residents and staff were included in the first phase of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination in the United States. Because the primary trial endpoint was vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic disease, there are limited data on the extent to which vaccines protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the ability to infect others (infectiousness). Assumptions about VE against infection and infectiousness have implications for changes to infection prevention guidance for vaccinated populations, including testing strategies.Methods: We use a stochastic agent-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious (Asymptomatic/Symptomatic)-Recovered model of a nursing home to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We model 3 scenarios, varying VE against infection, infectiousness, and symptoms, to understand the expected impact of vaccination in nursing homes, increasing staff vaccination coverage, and different screening testing strategies under each scenario.Results: Increasing vaccination coverage in staff decreases total symptomatic cases in the nursing home (among staff and residents combined) in each VE scenario. In scenarios with 50% and 90% VE against infection and infectiousness, increasing staff coverage reduces symptomatic cases among residents. If vaccination only protects against symptoms, and asymptomatic cases remain infectious, increased staff coverage increases symptomatic cases among residents. However, this is outweighed by the reduction in symptomatic cases among staff. Higher frequency testing-more than once weekly-is needed to reduce total symptomatic cases if the vaccine has lower efficacy against infection and infectiousness, or only protects against symptoms.Conclusions: Encouraging staff vaccination is not only important for protecting staff, but might also reduce symptomatic cases in residents if a vaccine confers at least some protection against infection or infectiousness.	10.21430/M31WZ81NLC	N	COVID-19, nursing homes,vaccine efficacy,Skilled Nursing Facilities, United States, Vaccination		Not Specified		2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44		2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	89.0	0.0	in silico Model	Mathematical Modeling to Inform Vaccination Strategies and Testing Approaches for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Nursing Homes	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	Y	Harvard University			aleliu_20220525_32551	PMID34086877_study-01	6661.0	2022-05-25 10:20:15.0	aleliu	2022-06-17 01:52:23.0	heschaefer	4957.0	2022-06-15 22:27:46.0	heschaefer	2022-06-15 22:27:46.0	heschaefer	NIH	We will develop methods to enhance the design and analysis of serologic studies of populations with respect to COVID-19, including methods that may be generalized in the future to address challenges raised by other seasonal diseases (such as influenza) and newly emerging diseases.

Much effort has been devoted to measuring these phenotypes, but understanding their impact on the course of the pandemic-especially that of immune escape-has remained a challenge. Here, we use a mathematical model to simulate the dynamics of wild-type and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of vaccine rollout and nonpharmaceutical interventions. We show that variants with enhanced transmissibility frequently increase epidemic severity, whereas those with partial immune escape either fail to spread widely or primarily cause reinfections and breakthrough infections. However, when these phenotypes are combined, a variant can continue spreading even as immunity builds up in the population, limiting the impact of vaccination and exacerbating the epidemic.

We will develop novel tests, using the most informative markers, to screen the mouth, upper airways and blood in high risk populations, which will predict who will get seriously sick and who will be minimally impacted by the virus	2022-08-31 00:00:00.0	U01CA260539	https://reporter.nih.gov/search/a5-TZyPvtEmmNzk75UarxA/project-details/10222232	Early Drivers of Humoral Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 Infections	100.0	2020-09-30 00:00:00.0	2021-11-19 17:42:13.0	Zhiping.gu	2022-06-15 22:29:17.0	heschaefer	NIH	NCI Serological Sciences Network for COVID-19 (SeroNet)		https://frederick.cancer.gov/seronet, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-20-038.html, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-20-039.html	SeroNet	2020-09-30 00:00:00.0	2021-04-15 09:37:08.0	heschaefer	2021-04-15 09:44:07.0	heschaefer		PMID33993265_file-01.docx~deid_data_33993265.csv	COVID-19	COVID-19	aleliu_20220526_32589	2022-05-26 11:45:13.0	SYSTEM	2022-05-26 11:45:13.0	SYSTEM	PTL10727	aleliu_20220526_32589	2022-05-26 11:45:13.0	aleliu	2022-05-26 11:45:13.0	aleliu	Study Protocol	PMID33993265_protocol-01.PTL10727.txt	PMID33993265_protocol-01	PMID33993265_protocol-01.txt	workspace/6661/protocol/PMID33993265_protocol-01.PTL10727.txt	Study Protocol	aleliu_20220406_31925	PMID33993265_protocol-01	6661	2022-04-06 13:40:11.0	aleliu	2022-04-06 13:40:11.0	aleliu

Generation of human long-lived plasma cells by developmentally regulated epigenetic imprinting	N		2.0	N	Antibody secreting cells (ASCs) circulate after vaccination and infection and migrate to the BM where a subset known as long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) persists and secrete antibodies for a lifetime. The mechanisms by which circulating ASCs become LLPCs are not well elucidated. Here, we show that human blood ASCs have distinct morphology, transcriptomes, and epigenetics compared with BM LLPCs. Compared with blood ASCs, BM LLPCs have decreased nucleus/cytoplasm ratio but increased endoplasmic reticulum and numbers of mitochondria. LLPCs up-regulate pro-survival genes MCL1, BCL2, and BCL-XL while simultaneously down-regulating pro-apoptotic genes HRK1, CASP3, and CASP8 Consistent with reduced gene expression, the pro-apoptotic gene loci are less accessible in LLPCs. Of the pro-survival genes, only BCL2 is concordant in gene up-regulation and loci accessibility. Using a novel in vitro human BM mimetic, we show that blood ASCs undergo similar morphological and molecular changes that resemble ex vivo BM LLPCs. Overall, our study demonstrates that early-minted blood ASCs in the BM microniche must undergo morphological, transcriptional, and epigenetic changes to mature into apoptotic-resistant LLPCs.	10.21430/M3W5SK65XI	N	Adolescent, Adult, Apoptosis , Biomarkers, Cell Survival, Epigenesis, Genetic, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Genetic Heterogeneity, Genomic Imprinting, Histocytochemistry, Humans, Immunophenotyping, Male, Middle Aged, cytology, immunology, metabolism, ultrastructure, Time Factors, Young Adult		Not Specified		2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44		2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	63.0	18.0		Generation of human long-lived plasma cells by developmentally regulated epigenetic imprinting	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	Y	University of Emory	36.0		aleliu_20220526_32653	PMID34952892_study-01	6661.0	2022-05-26 16:25:14.0	aleliu	2022-06-17 02:01:17.0	heschaefer	4953.0	2022-06-15 22:30:10.0	heschaefer	2022-06-15 22:30:10.0	heschaefer	NIH	The Emory SeroNet U54 program brings together a multidisciplinary team of scientists to address unmet needs relating to protective immunity against SARS CoV-2 infection.

109	SDY1975		5.0		Years	AdCOVID promotes concomitant systemic and mucosal immunity and represents a promising vaccine candidate	Single-Dose Intranasal Administration of AdCOVID Elicits Systemic and Mucosal Immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and Fully Protects Mice from Lethal Challenge	N		2.0	N	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for effective prophylactic vaccination to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Intranasal vaccination is an attractive strategy to prevent COVID-19 as the nasal mucosa represents the first-line barrier to SARS-CoV-2 entry. The current intramuscular vaccines elicit systemic immunity but not necessarily high-level mucosal immunity. Here, we tested a single intranasal dose of our candidate adenovirus type 5-vectored vaccine encoding the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (AdCOVID) in inbred, outbred, and transgenic mice. A single intranasal vaccination with AdCOVID elicited a strong and focused immune response against RBD through the induction of mucosal IgA in the respiratory tract, serum neutralizing antibodies, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a Th1-like cytokine expression profile. A single AdCOVID dose resulted in immunity that was sustained for over six months. Moreover, a single intranasal dose completely protected K18-hACE2 mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge, preventing weight loss and mortality. These data show that AdCOVID promotes concomitant systemic and mucosal immunity and represents a promising vaccine candidate.	10.21430/M3O55DEMO6	N	COVID-19, IgA, SARS-CoV-2, adenovirus vector, intranasal, mucosal immunity, receptor binding domain, vaccine, viral vector		Female, Male, Not Specified		2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	AdCOVID	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	DR44	89.0	0.0		Single-Dose Intranasal Administration of AdCOVID Elicits Systemic and Mucosal Immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and Fully Protects Mice from Lethal Challenge	2022-06-22 00:00:00.0	Y	NCI			aleliu_20220527_32699	PMID34452006_study-01	6661.0	2022-05-27 11:00:15.0	heschaefer	2022-08-16 02:35:00.0	heschaefer	4947.0	2022-06-15 22:17:34.0	heschaefer	2022-06-15 22:17:34.0	heschaefer	NIH	This is an initiative in support of the SARS-CoV-2 Serological Sciences, Sero Network.

115	SDY1978		7.0		Years	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019. Few studies have compared replication dynamics and host responses to SARS-CoV-2 in cell lines from different tissues and species. Therefore, we investigated the role of tissue type and antiviral genes during SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonhuman primate (kidney) and human (liver, respiratory epithelial, gastric) cell lines. We report different viral growth kinetics and release among the cell lines despite comparable ACE2 expression. Transcriptomics revealed that absence of STAT1 in nonhuman primate cells appeared to enhance inflammatory responses without effecting infectious viral titer. Deletion of RL-6 in respiratory epithelial cells increased viral replication. Impaired infectious virus release was detected in Huh7 but not Huh7.5 cells, suggesting a role for RIG1. Gastric cells MKN45 exhibited robust antiviral gene expression and supported viral replication. Data here provide insight into molecular pathogenesis of and alternative cell lines for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection.

120	SDY2012		5.0		Years	There are major knowledge gaps for managing patients with lung cancer in the COVID-19 era which need to be filled. To address these key issues, we prospectively studied the magnitude and kinetics of the humoral response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in a well annotated lung cancer population.	Longitudinal COVID-19-vaccination-induced antibody responses and Omicron neutralization in patients with lung cancer	N		0.0	N	During the global pandemic with COVID19, early reports indicated that cancer patients in general, and lung cancer patients in particular, who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 had high mortality rates, with a reported 25%–40% case fatality rate (CFR) (Rolfo et al., 2022). The underlying clinical, demographic, and tumor-biologic factors contributing to the aggressive course of infection in this vulnerable cancer population have not been fully elucidated and could arise through multiple mechanisms, including the immunosuppressive activity of lung cancer therapeutics, lung cancer itself, or other co-morbidities particularly related to the respiratory system (Kuderer et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021; Lievre et al., 2020). In December 2020, phase III randomized clinical trials demonstrated strong clinical efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, which subsequently became available to the public in the United States, but did not specifically evaluate lung cancer patients (Baden et al., 2021; Chavez-Macgregor et al., 2022). Additionally, the recently emergent Omicron variants largely evade vaccination-induced immunity. It has been shown that third mRNA vaccine doses increase Omicron antibody neutralization in the general population; however, the efficacy of this third dose remains unknown in patients with lung cancer (Planas et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022; Nemet et al., 2022).
