    "study_description": "Limited initial supply of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS CoV 2  vaccine raises the question of how to prioritize available doses. We used a mathematical model to compare five age stratified prioritization strategies. A highly effective transmission blocking vaccine prioritized to adults ages 20 to 49 years minimized cumulative incidence  but mortality and years of life lost were minimized in most scenarios when the vaccine was prioritized to adults greater than 60 years old. Use of individual level serological tests to redirect doses to seronegative individuals improved the marginal impact of each dose while potentially reducing existing inequities in COVID 19 impact. Although maximum impact prioritization strategies were broadly consistent across countries  transmission rates  vaccination rollout speeds  and estimates of naturally acquired immunity  this framework can be used to compare impacts of prioritization strategies across contexts.",
