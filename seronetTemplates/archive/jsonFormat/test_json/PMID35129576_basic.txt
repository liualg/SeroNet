basic_study_design	Schema Version 3.36									
Please do not delete or edit this column	The basic study design template defines and annotates key elements of a study including the purpose, subject grouping, schedule of events, personnel, and references (weblinks, publications). Use the study_design_edit template to add additional information for a study after a study is defined in ImmPort. The basic study design template consists of several sections or compound templates. Some compound templates are required: study, arm_or_cohort, inclusion_exclusion, planned_visit, study_2_condition_or_disease, study_2_protocol, study_categorization, study_personnel.  Other compound templates are optional: study_file, study_link, and study_pubmed.

Brief Title	Durability of Anti-Spike Antibodies in Infants After Maternal COVID-19 Vaccination or Natural Infection									
Official Title	Durability of Anti-Spike Antibodies in Infants After Maternal COVID-19 Vaccination or Natural Infection									
Brief Description	To evaluate the persistence of vaccine-induced maternal anti-S IgG in infant blood and compared persistence of infant anti-S IgG after maternal vaccination vs natural infection.									
Description	Understanding the persistence of maternal antibody levels in infants is important because COVID-19 infections in this age group account for a disproportionate burden of pediatric SARS-CoV-2–associated morbidity6 and because COVID-19 vaccines are not currently planned for administration to infants younger than 6 months. Study limitations include the small number of infants, the longer mean time to follow-up in the infected group (due to pragmatic constraints related to timing of COVID-19 surges in Boston and the availability of participants for timely follow-up), and the reporting of antibody titers rather than clinical outcomes. Although the antibody titer known to be protective against COVID-19 in infants isunknown, these findings provide further incentive for pregnant individuals to pursue COVID-19 vaccination.
