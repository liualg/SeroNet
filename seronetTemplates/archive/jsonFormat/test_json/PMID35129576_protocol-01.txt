Methods

The study included individuals who had received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy or were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 20 to 32 weeks’ gestation, had 
enrolled in a prospective study at 2 academic medical centers in Boston, and had enrolled their infants in this follow-up study conducted from July 21, 2021, 
to October 22, 2021. Individuals vaccinated or infected at 20 to 32 weeks’ gestation were enrolled because previous studies have demonstrated superior 
transplacental transfer of antibodies during this window compared with vaccination closer to delivery.4,5 Those infected before vaccination were excluded. 
Matched maternal and umbilical cord serum samples were collected at birth. Infant capillary serum samples were collected via microneedle device at 2 months 
after birth for infants of vaccinated mothers and at 6 months for infants of mothers who were vaccinated and mothers who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. 
Antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (eMethods in the Supplement). Differences 
in titers between vaccinated and infected groups at delivery and 6-month infant age were assessed by the Mann-Whitney U test. Differences in proportions of 
infants with detectable antibodies at 6 months were assessed by the Fisher exact test. Correlation between delivery titers and infant antibody was assessed 
via the Spearman rank test. Analyses were conducted using Prism version 9.0. Significance was defined as a 2-sided P < .05. The study was approved by the Mass General
Brigham institutional review board, and all participants provided written informed consent.
