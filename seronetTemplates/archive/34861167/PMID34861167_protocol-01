Experimental model and subject details

Recruitment and informed consent of research participants
Research participants were recruited by public announcement. Informed consent for research participation and collection of blood and nasopharyngeal swab specimens was obtained, with research volunteers signing a consent form approved by the Ethics Review Board at the Ministry of Health of Mongolia. Blood specimens were collected in a five-day period from July 3 to 7, 2021. Of the initial 794 participants enrolled in the study, 196 participants (111 females and 85 males, aged 20-85) balanced according to age, sex and time post-second vaccine dose were selected for serological analysis, with 47, 50, 45 and 54 recipients of the Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Sputnik V and Sinopharm vaccines, respectively. Research participants were healthy at the time of sample collection and had no known history of immunodeficiency. No other procedures or medications were recorded. An additional 99 participants (67 females and 32 males, aged 20-72) who had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination (1, 21, 4 and 73 recipients of the Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Sputnik V and Sinopharm vaccines, respectively) confirmed by real-time PCR or rapid diagnostic testing (RDT), were also studied with serological assays. Average time between infection and sample collection was 18 days (range from 7 to 63 days). Demographic data for this study are available at Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/hy3zm69f57.1.

Care and maintenance of cell lines
Human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) and human ACE2-expressing HeLa cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in DMEM (Cytiva) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich), and Penicillin-Streptomycin-Glutamine (Life Technologies). At 90% confluence, cells were washed with Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered Saline, without calcium and magnesium (Cytiva), and chemically dissociated by 0.05% trypsin-EDTA with Phenol Red (GIBCO). Cells were gently pipetted and sub-cultured at a 1:5-1:10 ratio.

Method details

Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) IgG binding assay
Vaccine recipient plasma samples were heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min. IgG antibodies targeting the Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), spike (S) and spike receptor binding domain (RBD) were detected using MSD V-PLEX Coronavirus Panel 4 (IgG) kits (Meso Scale Discovery) according to the manufacturer protocols. The kits measure samples in a 96-well plate by multiplexed indirect serology using patterned arrays of the target antigens and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection. Plasma samples were analyzed in duplicate at a 1:5,000 dilution, detected with anti-human IgG antibodies labeled with an ECL label (SULFO-TAG), and quantified with an MSD MESO QuickPlex SQ 120 instrument. Sample dilution of 1:5000 ensured that measured antibody concentrations were within the linear range of the ECL assay (Figure S3A). In addition to test samples, each plate contained a blank well, three positive control samples, and a 7-point calibration curve in duplicate generated by serial dilution of a reference standard. The calibration sample data for each antigen was fit to a 4-parameter logistic (4-PL) model using 1/Y2 weighting. Antibody unit concentrations (MSD AU/mL) for samples were calculated by backfitting ECL signals to the models.

ACE2-variant RBD antibody blocking assays
Antibodies blocking the binding of ACE2 protein to SARS-CoV-2 RBD for viral variants Alpha (N501Y), Beta (K417N, E484K, N501Y), Gamma (K417T, E484K, N501Y), Delta (L452R, T478K), Epsilon (L452R), Eta/Iota/Zeta (E484K), Kappa (L452R, E484Q), B.1.526.2 (S477N) and P.3 (E484K, N501Y), and Wuhan-Hu-1were detected with MSD V-PLEX SARS-CoV-2 Panel 11 (ACE2) kits according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Heat inactivated plasma samples from vaccinees were analyzed in duplicate at a dilution of 1:10. Samples were added to wells of 96-well plates presenting arrays of the different RBDs and incubated to allow antibodies in the samples to bind. Human ACE2 protein conjugated with the SULFO-TAG label was then added to the wells. After incubating to let labeled ACE2 bind to ACE2-binding sites that were not blocked by antibodies, the plates were read with a MESO QuickPlex SQ 120 instrument. In addition to the test samples, each plate contained a 7-point calibration curve in duplicate generated by serial dilution of a reference standard and a blank well. Results are reported as percent inhibition calculated based on the equation ((1 – Average Sample ECL Signal / Average ECL signal of blank well) x 100).

Production of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus
As previously described by Crawford et al. (Crawford et al., 2020), HEK293T cells were transfected via calcium phosphate with a five-plasmid 3rd generation lentiviral system composed of a lentiviral packaging vector (pHAGE_Luc2_IRES_ZsGreen-W), SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 Spike plasmid (pHDM-IDTSpike_fixK), and 3 Helper plasmids containing Gag-Pol (pHDM-Hgpm2), Tat (pHDM-Tat1b), and Rev (pRC-CMV_Rev1b). Briefly, HEK293T cells were plated in 10 cm tissue culture dishes and grown to 70% confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Penicillin/Streptomycin/Glutamine, and 10 mM HEPES. Plasmids were combined in 500 μL of water in the following quantities: 10 μg lentiviral packaging vector, 3.4 μg Spike plasmid, 2.2 μg each Helper plasmid. 500 μL 2X HEPES-Buffered Saline was added dropwise to the DNA mixture followed by 100 μL 2.5 M Calcium Chloride dropwise while agitating the mixture to avoid clumping the DNA. After a 20 min incubation at room temperature, the transfection reaction was added dropwise to the cells with gentle swirling. After 24 h incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2, media was gently aspirated from cells, spun down (300 x g, 5 min) to remove cellular debris, then passed through a 0.45 μm filter, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C.

Pseudovirus neutralization assay
HeLa cells expressing human ACE2 were plated on the inner 60 wells of a 96-well white-walled, flat clear bottom plates at a density of 5,000 cells per well (100 uL of a 50,000 cell/mL suspension). 200 μL of PBS was placed in the outer wells to reduce evaporation during incubation periods. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2, media was replaced with 100 μL of pseudovirus/serum mixtures, with virus only wells serving as a positive control and media only wells as a negative control. To prepare pseudovirus/serum mixtures, serum was heat inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min, diluted 1:25 in media, then serial diluted by 2-fold. Pseudovirus was diluted 1:2 with media and supplemented with Polybrene at 1:1,000 to improve infection efficiency. Serum dilutions and pseudovirus was then combined 1:1 for a final starting dilution of 1:50. After 48 h incubation, plates were read by replacing 50 μL of pseudovirus/serum mixture with 50 μL Perkin Elmer BriteLite Plus Luciferase reagent. Plates were read by BioTek Synergy 2 plate reader.

SARS-CoV-2 variant genotyping
Total nucleic acids were extracted from 182 SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens (300 μL) using the Chemagic Viral DNA/RNA 300 Kit on the Chemagic 360 extraction instrument (both from Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Purified nucleic acid eluates were genotyped using a multiplex, mutation-specific RT-qPCR targeting N501Y, E484K, and L452R, as previously described (Wang et al., 2021). A second confirmatory genotyping RT-qPCR assay was then used to identify the Alpha variant in N501Y mutation-positive samples (n = 177) from the first multiplex reaction. For this assay we designed primers and a dual-labeled hydrolysis probe targeting spike del69-70 (Table S2). The N501Y mutation was also included as a positive control, as this Alpha variant confirmation assay was run only on samples positive for N501Y in the first reaction. The del69-70 mutation was selected for Alpha variant confirmation given that 99.93% (929,411/930,076) of adequately covered [unidentified nucleotides (N) < 5%], full-length SARS-CoV-2 sequences in GISAID (as of June 22, 2021) with N501Y and del69-70 belonged to the Alpha variant B.1.1.7 lineage. Primers and probes for the spike P681H mutation were also included in the reaction, but this target was not utilized in this study.

Primer/probe mix (1 μL, final concentration 360 nM each primer, 80 nM each probe) was combined with a one-step RT-qPCR system (12.5 μL master mix + 0.5 μL Taq polymerase, SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR Kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad), nuclease-free water (6 μL), and template (5 μL) in a 25 μL reaction. All experiments were conducted on a BioRad CFX96 real-time PCR instrument (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). One mutant control (pooled mutant ssDNA) and one wild-type control (whole-genome synthetic RNA from Twist Bioscience, South San Francisco, CA) were included in each RT-qPCR experiment. Cycling conditions were as follows: 52 °C for 15:00, 94 °C for 2:00, and then 45 cycles of 94 °C for 00:15, 59.0 °C for 00:40, and 68 °C for 00:20. Fluorescence thresholds were manually set at 500 for both N501Y-FAM and del69-70-HEX.
