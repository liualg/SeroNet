As a result, researchers can examine the amount of protein in a given sample and compare levels between several groups. Other techniques also using antibodies allow detection of proteins in tissues (immunohistochemistry) and cells (immunocytochemistry). The confirmatory HIV test employs a western blot to detect anti-HIV antibody in a human serum sample.

Creatine has been found throughout most human tissues, and has also been detected in most biofluids, including sweat, blood, saliva, and breast milk. Within the cell, creatine is primarily located in the cytoplasm, mitochondria and myelin sheath. Creatine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, S-Adenosylmethionine and creatine can be biosynthesized from guanidoacetic acid and S-adenosylhomocysteine; which is catalyzed by the enzyme guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase. In addition, S-Adenosylhomocysteine and creatine can be biosynthesized from S-adenosylmethionine and guanidoacetic acid through the action of the enzyme guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase. In humans, creatine is involved in the glycine and serine metabolism pathway and the arginine and proline metabolism pathway. Creatine is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the NON ketotic hyperglycinemia pathway, creatine deficiency, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency, L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency, and the hyperprolinemia type I pathway. Creatine is a potentially toxic compound. Creatine has been found to be associated with several diseases known as rhabdomyolysis, cirrhosis, cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome 3, and schizophrenia; creatine has also been linked to the inborn metabolic disorders including hypermethioninemia.",

L-Lysine has been found throughout all human tissues, and has also been detected in most biofluids, including feces, blood, sweat, and cerebrospinal fluid. Within the cell, L-lysine is primarily located in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, nucleus and peroxisome. L-Lysine exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. L-Lysine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, L-Lysine and oxoglutaric acid can be converted into saccharopine; which is mediated by the enzyme Alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase, mitochondrial. Furthermore, L-Lysine can be converted into L-lysine through its interaction with the enzyme low affinity cationic amino acid transporter 2. Finally, L-Lysine and S-adenosylmethionine can be converted into N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine and S-adenosylhomocysteine; which is mediated by the enzyme histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SETD7. In humans, L-lysine is involved in the biotin metabolism pathway, the lysine degradation pathway, carnitine synthesis pathway, and the pyridoxine dependency with seizures pathway. L-Lysine is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the hyperlysinemia II or saccharopinuria pathway, the saccharopinuria/hyperlysinemia II pathway, the glutaric aciduria type I pathway, and the hyperlysinemia I, familial pathway.

    "description" : "N-Acetylneuraminic acid, also known as N-acetylneuraminate or beta-neu5ac, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as n-acylneuraminic acids. These are neuraminic acids carrying an N-acyl substituent. N-Acetylneuraminic acid exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). N-Acetylneuraminic acid has been found throughout most human tissues, and has also been detected in most biofluids, including breast milk, feces, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood. Within the cell, N-acetylneuraminic acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm, nucleus, lysosome and myelin sheath. N-Acetylneuraminic acid participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, N-Acetylneuraminic acid can be biosynthesized from N-acetylmannosamine and phosphoenolpyruvic acid through its interaction with the enzyme sialic acid synthase. In addition, N-Acetylneuraminic acid can be converted into N-acetylmannosamine and pyruvic acid; which is mediated by the enzyme N-acetylneuraminate lyase. In humans, N-acetylneuraminic acid is involved in the amino sugar metabolism pathway. N-Acetylneuraminic acid is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the tay-sachs disease pathway, the salla disease/infantile sialic Acid storage disease pathway, the g(m2)-gangliosidosis: variant b, tay-sachs disease pathway, and the sialuria or french type sialuria pathway. N-Acetylneuraminic acid has been found to be associated with the diseases known as sialidosis, normosomatic type; n-acetylneuraminic acid has also been linked to the inborn metabolic disorders including salla disease.",

PC(22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z)) participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, S-Adenosylhomocysteine and PC(22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z)) can be biosynthesized from S-adenosylmethionine and pe-nme2(22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z)) through the action of the enzyme phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase.

    "description" : "PE(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)), also known as GPEtn(38:6) or phophatidylethanolamine(18:2/20:4), belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phosphatidylethanolamines. These are glycerophosphoetahnolamines in which two fatty acids are bonded to the glycerol moiety through ester linkages. Thus, PE(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) is considered to be a glycerophosphoethanolamine lipid molecule. PE(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. PE(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) has been found throughout all human tissues, and has also been primarily detected in blood. Within the cell, PE(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) is primarily located in the membrane (predicted from logP) and intracellular membrane. PE(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Cytidine monophosphate and PE(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) can be biosynthesized from CDP-ethanolamine and DG(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)/0:0); which is catalyzed by the enzyme choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase. Furthermore, PE(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) can be biosynthesized from PS(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)); which is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphatidylserine decarboxylase. Furthermore, PE(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) can be biosynthesized from PS(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)); which is mediated by the enzyme phosphatidylserine decarboxylase. Finally, Cytidine monophosphate and PE(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) can be biosynthesized from CDP-ethanolamine and DG(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)/0:0); which is catalyzed by the enzyme choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase. In humans, PE(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) is involved in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis PC(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) pathway and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis pe(18:2(9Z,12Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) pathway.",

In particular, L-Glutamic acid and pyruvic acid can be biosynthesized from L-alanine and oxoglutaric acid through the action of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase 1. Furthermore, Pyruvic acid can be converted into oxalacetic acid; which is mediated by the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase, mitochondrial. Furthermore, Pyruvic acid can be biosynthesized from pyruvaldehyde through the action of the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, mitochondrial. Finally, Pyruvic acid and L-serine can be converted into hydroxypyruvic acid and L-alanine; which is catalyzed by the enzyme serine--pyruvate aminotransferase. In humans, pyruvic acid is involved in the gluconeogenesis pathway, the pyruvate metabolism pathway, the alanine metabolism pathway, and the oncogenic action OF fumarate pathway. Pyruvic acid is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the lactic acidemia pathway, 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria/succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, the sialuria or french type sialuria pathway, and the glycogenosis, type vii. tarui disease pathway.

Serotonin has been found throughout most human tissues, and has also been primarily detected in feces, urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. Within the cell, serotonin is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Serotonin can be converted into serotonin; which is catalyzed by the enzyme sodium-dependent serotonin transporter. In humans, serotonin is involved in the methadone action pathway, the ethylmorphine action pathway, the oxycodone action pathway, and the ropivacaine action pathway. Serotonin is also involved in the metabolic disorder called the dimethylthiambutene action pathway. Serotonin has been found to be associated with several diseases known as schizophrenia, brunner syndrome, hypothyroidism, and parkinson's disease; serotonin has also been linked to the inborn metabolic disorders including aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency.",

D-Glucitol is a drug which is used as a non-stimulant laxative via an oral suspension or enema. D-Glucitol exists as a solid, soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). D-Glucitol has been found throughout most human tissues, and has also been detected in most biofluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, feces, and urine. D-Glucitol exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. In humans, D-glucitol is involved in the galactose metabolism pathway, the fructose and mannose degradation pathway, and the fructose intolerance, hereditary pathway. D-Glucitol is also involved in a couple of metabolic disorders, which include the fructosuria pathway and the galactosemia pathway. Outside of the human body, D-glucitol can be found in a number of food items such as purslane, soy bean, lemon balm, and rocket salad (ssp.). This makes D-glucitol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.",

Finally, Sucrose can be biosynthesized from Alpha-D-glucose and D-fructose through its interaction with the enzyme sucrase-isomaltase, intestinal. In humans, sucrose is involved in the galactose metabolism pathway and the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway. Sucrose is also involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include the glycogenosis, type iii. cori disease, debrancher glycogenosis pathway, the glycogenosis, type vi. hers disease pathway, the galactosemia pathway, and the mucopolysaccharidosis vi. sly syndrome pathway. Outside of the human body, sucrose can be found in a number of food items such as horchata, eastern oyster, corn grits, and rye.

In particular, Urocanic acid can be biosynthesized from L-histidine; which is mediated by the enzyme histidine ammonia-lyase. In addition, Urocanic acid can be biosynthesized from L-histidine; which is mediated by the enzyme histidine ammonia-lyase. In humans, urocanic acid is involved in the histidine metabolism pathway. Urocanic acid is also involved in a couple of metabolic disorders, which include the histidinemia pathway and the ammonia recycling pathway. Outside of the human body, urocanic acid can be found in mung bean. This makes urocanic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product.",
