It is used by the ImmPort Data\n          Package Validator and Upload Processing software to ensure the current version of the\n          template is being used. The Schema version refers to the database schema structure and\n          content (in particular the preferred terms and reference data). These version tags should\n          not be modified by the user. ", "As a reminder, the spreadsheet versions of the templates are provided for benefit\n          of the data providers to enable display of comments and lists in the spreadsheet. The\n          templates uploaded to ImmPort should be saved as tab-delimited text files. Template names\n          should match the names as they appear on the ImmPort web pages. File names are not case\n          sensitive. However, downloading templates from a web browser may cause your computer to\n          append a suffix to the file name and this will prevent ImmPort from recognizing a template\n          name." ]

  "paragraphs" : [ "The ImmPort data upload workflow is intended to be incremental or modular. You\n          can send one or a few ImmPort upload templates and associated files (e.g. protocols or\n          results) in a data upload package ZIP archive. Or, you can send in many templates and\n          associated files. The order of uploading templates (study before subject or subject before\n          study?) is determined by what descriptive data is referenced within a template and\n          therefore what dependencies exist for an uploaded template to be successfully processed.\n          For example, successfully uploading a subject template requires that a protocol and study\n          arm be referenced, so both the protocol and study design template need to be in the same\n          ZIP archive as the subject template or already uploaded and processed in ImmPort.\n          Individual files contained in the package cannot exceed 2 GBytes (2^31-1 = 2,147,483,647\n          bytes) in size." ]

Studies\n          organize subjects into groups (e.g. arms or cohorts) based on phenotype and/or treatment.\n          The planned visit schedule provides a guide as to the temporal relationship between\n          samples and encounters (i.e is the sample taken before or after a treatment). If the\n          research includes seasonally variable treatments (e.g seasonal influenza vaccine), a\n          separate study should be created for each season.", "Subjects: Subjects may be patients or animals from which samples are taken for\n          analysis. Two .xls templates (one for human and one for animal subjects) are available for\n          recording subject information. In these files, treatment protocols used on the subjects\n          can also be listed as well as many other details.
