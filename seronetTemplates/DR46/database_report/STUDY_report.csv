A broader observation of limited vaccine responses in cancer patients, particularly those with hematologic malignancies (Thakkar et al., 2021), has led to the implementation of additional (i.e., third dose) vaccine administration as a way to increase protection for patients with immune suppression. A third dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID19 vaccine has shown to be effective in preventing severe COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant in the general population (Bar-On et al., 2021; Barda et al., 2021). Furthermore, third-dose administration of either the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine was associated with augmented immune responses in a diverse cohort of cancer patients (Shapiro et al., 2022). However, the real-world effectiveness of additional dosing in myeloma patients and viral neutralization have not been reported. Additionally, the impact of the currently dominant SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant on efficacy of the third dose is largely unknown in patients with hematologic malignancies (Zeng et al., 2022).","Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna COVID-19 vaccine",COVID-19 Vaccines | COVID-19 prevention & control | Humans | Immunity Cellular | Multiple Myeloma therapy | SARS-CoV-2 | Vaccination,Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,Years,,Humoral and cellular immune responses after third-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination,Clinical Research,521,38,96

NDV-HXP-S is an inactivated egg-based recombinant Newcastle disease virus vaccine expressing the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It's being developed by public sector manufacturers in Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil; herein are initial results from Thailand. Methods: This phase 1 stage of a randomised, dose-escalation, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial was conducted at the Vaccine Trial Centre, Mahidol University (Bangkok). Healthy males and non-pregnant females, aged 18-59 years and negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, were eligible. Participants were randomised to receive one of six treatments by intramuscular injection twice, 28 days apart: 1 µg, 1 µg+CpG1018 (a toll-like receptor 9 agonist), 3 µg, 3 µg+CpG1018, 10 µg, or placebo. Participants and personnel assessing outcomes were masked to treatment. The primary outcomes were solicited and spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs) during 7 and 28 days after each vaccination, respectively. Secondary outcomes were immunogenicity measures (anti-S IgG and pseudotyped virus neutralisation). An interim analysis assessed safety at day 57 in treatment-exposed individuals and immunogenicity through day 43 per protocol. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04764422). Findings: Between March 20 and April 23, 2021, 377 individuals were screened and 210 were enroled (35 per group); all received dose one; five missed dose two. The most common solicited AEs among vaccinees, all predominantly mild, were injection site pain (<63%), fatigue (<35%), headache (<32%), and myalgia (<32%). The proportion reporting a vaccine-related AE ranged from 5·7% to 17·1% among vaccine groups and was 2·9% in controls; there was no vaccine-related serious adverse event. The 10 µg formulation's immunogenicity ranked best, followed by 3 µg+CpG1018, 3 µg, 1 µg+CpG1018, and 1 µg formulations. On day 43, the geometric mean concentrations of 50% neutralising antibody ranged from 122·23 international units per mL (IU/mL; 1 µg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 86·40-172·91) to 474·35 IU/mL (10 µg, 95% CI 320·90-701·19), with 93·9% to 100% of vaccine groups attaining a ≥ 4-fold increase over baseline.

Blocking either viral replication with Remdesivir or the downstream IFN stimulated cascade with anti-IFNAR2 in vivo in the chronic stages of disease attenuated the overactive immune-inflammatory response, especially inflammatory macrophages. Here, we show SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in lung-resident human macrophages is a critical driver of disease. In response to infection mediated by CD16 and ACE2 receptors, human macrophages activate inflammasomes, release IL-1 and IL-18 and undergo pyroptosis thereby contributing to the hyperinflammatory state of the lungs. Inflammasome activation and its accompanying inflammatory response is necessary for lung inflammation, as inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway reverses chronic lung pathology. Remarkably, this same blockade of inflammasome activation leads to the release of infectious virus by the infected macrophages. Thus, inflammasomes oppose host infection by SARS-CoV-2 by production of inflammatory cytokines and suicide by pyroptosis to prevent a productive viral cycle.",,Chronic inflammation | Inflammasome | SARS-CoV-2 | Viral infection,Yale University,Years,,Not Applicable,Preclinical Study,7,37,77

Whether natural immunity induced by the original SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 strain protects against rechallenge with these SARS-CoV-2 variants remains a critical unresolved question. In this study, we show that natural immunity induced by the WA1/2020 strain leads to partial but incomplete protection against the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.351 (beta) in rhesus macaques. We challenged rhesus macaques with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 and showed that infection with these variants resulted in high viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract. We then infected rhesus macaques with the WA1/2020 strain and rechallenged them on day 35 with the WA1/2020, B.1.1.7, or B.1.351 variants. Natural immunity to WA1/2020 led to robust protection against rechallenge with WA1/2020 but only partial protection against rechallenge with B.1.351. An intermediate degree of protection was observed in rhesus macaques against rechallenge with B.1.1.7.

Prioritizing vaccine rollout, and achievement of herd immunity depend on SARS-CoV-2 transmission reduction. The vaccine's effect on infectivity is thus a critical priority. Methods: Among all 9650 HCW of a large tertiary medical center in Israel, we calculated the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR cases with asymptomatic presentation, tested following known or presumed exposure and the infectious subset (N-gene-Ct-value<30) of these. Additionally, infection incidence rates were calculated for symptomatic cases and infectious (Ct<30) cases. Vaccine effectiveness within three months of vaccine rollout was measured as one minus the relative risk or rate ratio, respectively. To further assess infectiousness, we compared the mean Ct-value and the proportion of infections with a positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen test of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. The correlation between IgG levels within the week before detection and Ct level was assessed. Findings: Reduced prevalence among fully vaccinated HCW was observed for (i) infections detected due to exposure, with asymptomatic presentation (VE(i)=65.1%, 95%CI 45-79%), (ii) the presumed infectious (Ct<30) subset of these (VE(ii)=69.6%, 95%CI 43-84%) (iii) never-symptomatic infections (VE(iii)=72.3%, 95%CI 48-86%), and (iv) the presumed infectious (Ct<30) subset (VE(iv)=83.0%, 95%CI 51-94%).Incidence of (v) symptomatic and (vi) symptomatic-infectious cases was significantly lower among fully vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals (VE(v)= 89.7%, 95%CI 84-94%, VE(vi)=88.1%, 95%CI 80-95%).The mean Ct-value was significantly higher in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated (27.3±1.2 vs. 22.2±1.0, p<0.001) and the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests was also significantly lower among vaccinated vs. unvaccinated PCR-positive HCW (80% vs. 31%, p<0.001).

Data are needed to characterize these infections and define correlates of breakthrough and infectivity. Methods: At the largest medical center in Israel, we identified breakthrough infections by performing extensive evaluations of health care workers who were symptomatic (including mild symptoms) or had known infection exposure. These evaluations included epidemiologic investigations, repeat reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays, antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic testing (Ag-RDT), serologic assays, and genomic sequencing. Correlates of breakthrough infection were assessed in a case-control analysis. We matched patients with breakthrough infection who had antibody titers obtained within a week before SARS-CoV-2 detection (peri-infection period) with four to five uninfected controls and used generalized estimating equations to predict the geometric mean titers among cases and controls and the ratio between the titers in the two groups. We also assessed the correlation between neutralizing antibody titers and N gene cycle threshold (Ct) values with respect to infectivity. Results: Among 1497 fully vaccinated health care workers for whom RT-PCR data were available, 39 SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections were documented. Neutralizing antibody titers in case patients during the peri-infection period were lower than those in matched uninfected controls (case-to-control ratio, 0.361; 95% confidence interval, 0.165 to 0.787). Higher peri-infection neutralizing antibody titers were associated with lower infectivity (higher Ct values). Most breakthrough cases were mild or asymptomatic, although 19% had persistent symptoms (>6 weeks). The B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant was found in 85% of samples tested. A total of 74% of case patients had a high viral load (Ct value, <30) at some point during their infection; however, of these patients, only 17 (59%) had a positive result on concurrent Ag-RDT. No secondary infections were documented. Conclusions: Among fully vaccinated health care workers, the occurrence of breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2 was correlated with neutralizing antibody titers during the peri-infection period.

This study aimed to determine if prevaccination cytokine levels are associated with antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed among 58 SOTRs before and after two-dose mRNA vaccine series, 35 additional SOTRs before and after a third vaccine dose, and comparison to 16 healthy controls (HCs). Antispike antibody was assessed using the IgG Euroimmun ELISA. Electrochemiluminescence detection-based multiplexed sandwich immunoassays (Meso Scale Diagnostics) were used to quantify plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations (n = 20 analytes) and compare concentrations between SOTRs and HCs, stratified by ultimate antibody response to the vaccine using Wilcoxon-rank-sum test with false discovery rates computed to correct for multiple comparisons. Results: In the study population, 100% of HCs, 59% of SOTRs after 2 doses and 63% of SOTRs after 3 doses had a detectable antibody response. Multiple baseline cytokines were elevated in SOTRs versus HCs. There was no significant difference in baseline cytokine levels between SOTRs with high versus low-titer antibodies after 2 doses of vaccine. However, as compared with poor antibody responders, SOTRs who went on to develop a high-titer antibody response to a third dose of vaccine had significantly higher prethird dose levels of several innate immune cytokines including IL-17, IL-2Ra, IL-6, IP-10, MIP-1α, and TNF-α (false discovery rates < 0.05). Conclusions: A specific inflammatory profile may be associated with developing higher antibodies in response to a third dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in SOTRs.","Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna COVID-19 vaccine",Antibodies | Viral | COVID-19 Vaccines-adverse effects | COVID-19-prevention & control | Cross-Sectional Studies | Cytokines | Humans | Organ Transplantation-adverse effects | SARS-CoV-2 | Transplant Recipients | Vaccines | Synthetic | mRNA Vaccines,Johns Hopkins University,Years,,Measurement of cytokines and chemokines concentrations and compare concentrations between SOTRs and HCs,Serosurveillance ,109,20,79

However, it is still unknown whether CD4+ T cells from vaccinated individuals recognize peptides from bat coronaviruses that may have the potential of causing future pandemics. In this study, we identified a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitope (S815-827) that is conserved in coronaviruses from different genera and subgenera, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, multiple bat coronaviruses, and a feline coronavirus. Our results showed that S815-827 was recognized by 42% of vaccinated participants in our study who received the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1273) COVID-19 vaccines. Using T cell expansion and T cell receptor sequencing assays, we demonstrated that S815-827-reactive CD4+ T cells from the majority of responders cross-recognized homologous peptides from at least 6 other diverse coronaviruses. Our results support the hypothesis that the current mRNA vaccines elicit T cell responses that can cross-recognize bat coronaviruses and thus might induce some protection against potential zoonotic outbreaks.

Our findings support future tailored vaccination strategies against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants as mRNA-vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are highly variable among individuals.","Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna COVID-19 vaccine",Antibodies | Neutralizing immunology | Antibodies | Viral immunology | Antibody Formation | COVID-19 immunology | COVID-19 prevention & control | COVID-19 Vaccines administration & dosage | COVID-19 Vaccines immunology | Coronavirus immunology | Cross Reactions | Humans | Immunoglobulin G immunology | Mutation | SARS-CoV-2 genetics | SARS-CoV-2 immunology | Spike Glycoprotein | Coronavirus genetics | Spike Glycoprotein | Coronavirus immunology | Vaccination Vaccines | Synthetic administration & dosage | Vaccines | Synthetic immunology | mRNA Vaccines administration & dosage | mRNA Vaccines immunology,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Years,01-Jun-2020,Vaccine-induced antibody responses in mRNA vaccine receipents,Clinical Research,237,19,72

We performed a longitudinal analysis of pre-COVID19-pandemic samples from 2016-2019 in young adults and assessed CCC-specific CD4+ T cell and antibody responses. Notably, CCC responses were commonly detected with comparable frequencies as with other common antigens and were sustained over time. CCC-specific CD4+ T cell responses were associated with low HLA-DR+CD38+ signals, and their magnitude did not correlate with yearly CCC infection prevalence. Similarly, CCC-specific and spike RBD-specific IgG responses were stable in time. Finally, high CCC-specific CD4+ T cell reactivity, but not antibody titers, was associated with pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity. These results provide a valuable reference for understanding the immune response to endemic coronaviruses and suggest that steady and sustained CCC responses are likely from a stable pool of memory CD4+ T cells due to repeated earlier exposures and possibly occasional reinfections.",,CD4 | SARS-CoV-2 | T cells | common cold coronaviruses | immune memory | longitudinal analysis | steady state,La Jolla Institute For Immunology,Years,01-Jan-2016,Immunological memory to common cold coronaviruses,Epidemiological Research ,32,18,36

One important question that remains is whether the protection conferred by vaccines wanes over time. However, estimates over time are subject to bias from differential depletion of susceptible individuals between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. We examined the extent to which biases occur under different scenarios and assessed whether serological testing has the potential to correct this bias. By identifying nonvaccine antibodies, these tests could identify individuals with prior infection. We found that in scenarios with high baseline VE, differential depletion of susceptible individuals created minimal bias in VE estimates, suggesting that any observed declines are likely not due to spurious waning alone. However, if baseline VE was lower, the bias for leaky vaccines (which reduce individual probability of infection given contact) was larger and should be corrected for by excluding individuals with past infection if the mechanism is known to be leaky. Conducting analyses both unadjusted and adjusted for past infection could give lower and upper bounds for the true VE. Studies of VE should therefore enroll individuals regardless of prior infection history but also collect information, ideally through serological testing, on this critical variable.",,Bias | epidemics | SARS-CoV-2 | vaccines | waning,Harvard University,Years,,Not Applicable,Epidemiological Research ,20000,0,89

Methods: This prospective study enrolled 100 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and 208 of their household members in North Carolina though October 2020, including 44% who identified as Hispanic or non-White. Households were enrolled a median of 6 days from symptom onset in the index case. Incident secondary cases within the household were detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction of weekly nasal swabs (days 7, 14, 21) or by seroconversion at day 28. Results: Excluding 73 household contacts who were PCR-positive at baseline, the secondary attack rate (SAR) among household contacts was 32% (33 of 103; 95% confidence interval [CI], 22%-44%). The majority of cases occurred by day 7, with later cases confirmed as household-acquired by viral sequencing. Infected persons in the same household had similar nasopharyngeal viral loads (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.45; 95% CI, .23-.62). Households with secondary transmission had index cases with a median viral load that was 1.4 log10 higher than those without transmission (P = .03), as well as higher living density (more than 3 persons occupying fewer than 6 rooms; odds ratio, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.02-10.9). Minority households were more likely to experience high living density and had a higher risk of incident infection than did White households (SAR, 51% vs 19%; P = .01). Conclusions: Household crowding in the context of high-inoculum infections may amplify the spread of COVID-19, potentially contributing to disproportionate impact on communities of color.",,SARS-CoV-2 | Household transmission | Living density | Secondary attack rate | Viral load.,University of North Carolina School of Medicine,Years,01-Apr-2020,Household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection,Clinical Research,267,0,77

During an outbreak, restricting the size of these gatherings is one of several non-pharmaceutical interventions available to policy-makers to reduce transmission. Often these restrictions take the form of prohibitions on gatherings above a certain size. While it is generally agreed that such restrictions reduce contacts, the specific size threshold separating ""allowed"" from ""prohibited"" gatherings often does not have a clear scientific basis, which leads to dramatic differences in guidance across location and time. Building on the observation that gathering size distributions are often heavy-tailed, we develop a theoretical model of transmission during gatherings and their contribution to general disease dynamics. We find that a key, but often overlooked, determinant of the optimal threshold is the distribution of gathering sizes. Using data on pre-pandemic contact patterns from several sources as well as empirical estimates of transmission parameters for SARS-CoV-2, we apply our model to better understand the relationship between restriction threshold and reduction in cases. We find that, under reasonable transmission parameter ranges, restrictions may have to be set quite low to have any demonstrable effect on cases due to relative frequency of smaller gatherings. We compare our conceptual model with observed changes in reported contacts during lockdown in March of 2020",,COVID-19 | Epidemiology | Gatherings | Non-pharmaceutical intervention | SARS-coV-2,Harvard T.h.

Circulating autoantibodies neutralizing IFN-α, IFN-ω, and/or IFN-β are found in ∼20% of deceased patients across age groups, and in ∼1% of individuals aged <70 y and in >4% of those >70 y old in the general population. With a sample of 1,261 unvaccinated deceased patients and 34,159 individuals of the general population sampled before the pandemic, we estimated both IFR and relative risk of death (RRD) across age groups for individuals carrying autoantibodies neutralizing type I IFNs, relative to noncarriers. The RRD associated with any combination of autoantibodies was higher in subjects under 70 y old. For autoantibodies neutralizing IFN-α2 or IFN-ω, the RRDs were 17.0 (95% CI: 11.7 to 24.7) and 5.8 (4.5 to 7.4) for individuals <70 y and ≥70 y old, respectively, whereas, for autoantibodies neutralizing both molecules, the RRDs were 188.3 (44.8 to 774.4) and 7.2 (5.0 to 10.3), respectively. In contrast, IFRs increased with age, ranging from 0.17% (0.12 to 0.31) for individuals <40 y old to 26.7% (20.3 to 35.2) for those ≥80 y old for autoantibodies neutralizing IFN-α2 or IFN-ω, and from 0.84% (0.31 to 8.28) to 40.5% (27.82 to 61.20) for autoantibodies neutralizing both. Autoantibodies against type I IFNs increase IFRs, and are associated with high RRDs, especially when neutralizing both IFN-α2 and IFN-ω. Remarkably, IFRs increase with age, whereas RRDs decrease with age.

To aid in the prognostic classification of disease severity, we perform untargeted metabolomics on plasma from 339 patients, with samples collected at six longitudinal time points. Using the temporal metabolic profiles and machine learning, we build a predictive model of disease severity. We discover that a panel of metabolites measured at the time of study entry suc- cessfully determines disease severity. Through analysis of longitudinal samples, we confirm that most of these markers are directly related to disease progression and that their levels return to baseline upon disease recovery. Finally, we validate that these metabolites are also altered in a hamster model of COVID-19.

The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, was identified as a likely source of cases in early reports but later this conclusion became controversial. We show the earliest known COVID-19 cases from December 2019, including those without reported direct links, were geographically centered on this market. We report that live SARS-CoV-2 susceptible mammals were sold at the market in late 2019 and, within the market, SARS-CoV-2-positive environmental samples were spatially associated with vendors selling live mammals.

Here, we analyze the genomic diversity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We show that SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity before February 2020 likely comprised only two distinct viral lineages, denoted A and B. Phylodynamic rooting methods, coupled with epidemic simulations, reveal that these lineages were the result of at least two separate cross-species transmission events into humans. The first zoonotic transmission likely involved lineage B viruses around 18 November 2019 (23 October-8 December), while the separate introduction of lineage A likely occurred within weeks of this event. These findings indicate that it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 circulated widely in humans prior to November 2019 and define the narrow window between when SARS-CoV-2 first jumped into humans and when the first cases of COVID-19 were reported. As with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 emergence likely resulted from multiple zoonotic events.",,Animals | COVID-19-epidemiology | COVID-19-transmission | COVID-19-virology | Computer Simulation | Genetic Variation | Genomics-methods | Humans | Molecular Epidemiology | Pandemics | Phylogeny | SARS-CoV-2-classification | SARS-CoV-2-genetics | SARS-CoV-2-isolation & purification | Viral Zoonoses-epidemiology | Viral Zoonoses-virology,University of California,Years,14-Feb-2020,Not Applicable,Basic Research,,0,89
