  "description": "The subject animal template defines and annotates key elements of study subjects including demographics and links subjects to an arm within a study. In mouse studies, data providers may choose to define a single subject to represent a set of inbred mice treated the same way rather than describe each mouse (i.e. a cage of mice treated the same way). This approach is driven by how the assay results are recorded: if assay results are available for individual animals, then each animal should be defined to ImmPort.",
