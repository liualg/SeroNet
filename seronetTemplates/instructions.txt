* What this file has

This folder contains the scripts, training video, and links to related documents to SeroNet's ETL scripts. The files was

* Folder Structure

SeroNet scripts has two main areas. Offical scripts (Offical Uplaod Scripts) and General Scripts (Helpful Curation Scripts). 

Offical scripts contains all files need to upload data to ImmPort for general curation, updates, parsing data into ImmPort subject level information. These files will have documentation and have supporting SOPs to get everything running smoothly.  

General Scripts contains everything else! These are scripts that I developed to pull data a little quicker from the web, to navigate ImmPorts API, Folder creations, ... etc. All files are aptly named -- documentation will be limited on these files, as these were bits of code that I found helpful while working on curation. 


* How to get started

Download your own copy of the script from teams onto your local computer 

Everything written here is in python. Please install the latest version of python. 
This is pythons offical website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once the file is downloaded, open it up and click through installation guide. 

Upon completetion, please open up command prompt/shell to check that python is correctly install. 
(Windows / Mac--os)>>   python --version
(Windows / Mac--os)>    Python x.x.x

Check to see if PIP is installed. 
(Windows / Mac--os)>>   pip3 --version
(Windows / Mac--os)>    pip3 xx.x from /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/../../pip (python 3.12)


Find the requiremnts.txt file and change your current directory to where it is located. For this example the script is located in the Download directory still. 
(Windows)>> cd %USERPROFILE%\Downloads\Package
(Mac--os)>> cd ~/Downloads/Package

Install the requrements needed
(Windows / Mac--os)>>   pip install -r requiremnts.txt

You are now ready to run your script! Look for a run_me.py file
Example if you wanted to run the ImmPort template generation script
(Windows / Mac--os)>>   python createTemplates.py

To run the script without the gui you can use:
(Windows / Mac--os)>>   python createTemplates.py --Dev T --PMID xxxxxxxx


Detailed instructions will be in each folder.
