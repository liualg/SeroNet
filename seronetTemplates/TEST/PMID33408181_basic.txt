basic_study_design	Schema Version 3.34									
Please do not delete or edit this column	The basic study design template defines and annotates key elements of a study including the purpose, subject grouping, schedule of events, personnel, and references (weblinks, publications). Use the study_design_edit template to add additional information for a study after a study is defined in ImmPort. The basic study design template consists of several sections or compound templates. Some compound templates are required: study, arm_or_cohort, inclusion_exclusion, planned_visit, study_2_condition_or_disease, study_2_protocol, study_categorization, study_personnel.  Other compound templates are optional: study_file, study_link, and study_pubmed.

Official Title	Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection									
Brief Description	Understanding immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 has implica- tions for understanding protective immunity against COVID-19 and assessing the likely future course of the COVID-19 pandemic.									
Description	INTRODUCTION: Immunological memory is the basis for durable protective immunity after infections or vaccinations. Duration of immuno- logical memory after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 is unclear. Immunological mem- ory can consist of memory B cells, antibodies, memory CD4+ T cells, and/or memory CD8+ T cells. Knowledge of the kinetics and inter- relationships among those four types of mem- ory in humans is limited. Understanding immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 has implica- tions for understanding protective immunity against COVID-19 and assessing the likely future course of the COVID-19 pandemic.RATIONALE: Assessing virus-specific immune memory over at least a 6-month period is likely necessary to ascertain the durability of immune memory to SARS-CoV-2. Given the evidence that antibodies, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells can all participate in protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, we measured antigen-specific anti- bodies, memory B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in the blood from subjects who recovered from COVID-19, up to 8 months after infection.
