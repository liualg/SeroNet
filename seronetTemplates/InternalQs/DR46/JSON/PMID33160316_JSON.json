    "study_description": "We conducted a retrospective review of patients assessed for possible COVID-19 illness at our urban medical center in Los Angeles, California. We carefully reviewed all clinical records to ascertain the provider\u2019s level of clinical suspicion for COVID-19 illness and compared these assessments with available results of SARS-CoV-2 testing, in addition to longitudinal data on clinical outcomes. We found that the vast majority of patients (96% of N = 25) clinically assessed to have a low probability of COVID-19 illness were subsequently confirmed to have either a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result or, in the absence of testing, clinical stability without any further concern for COVID-19 illness (Table \u200b(Table1).1). All clinical assessments were performed by a physician, with some (16%) conducted by a nurse practitioner or physician assistant in conjunction with physician supervision.",
