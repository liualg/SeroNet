Through loss-of-function screening of 1,001 tumor suppressor genes, we identified death-associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK3) as a previously unrecognized driver of anti-tumor immunity through the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway of cytosolic DNA sensing. Loss of DAPK3 expression or kinase activity impaired STING activation and interferon (IFN)-β-stimulated gene induction. DAPK3 deficiency in IFN-β-producing tumors drove rapid growth and reduced infiltration of CD103+CD8α+ dendritic cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, attenuating the response to cancer chemo-immunotherapy. Mechanistically, DAPK3 coordinated post-translational modification of STING. In unstimulated cells, DAPK3 inhibited STING K48-linked poly-ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. After cGAMP stimulation, DAPK3 was required for STING K63-linked poly-ubiquitination and STING-TANK-binding kinase 1 interaction. Comprehensive phospho-proteomics uncovered a DAPK3-specific phospho-site on the E3 ligase LMO7, critical for LMO7-STING interaction and STING K63-linked poly-ubiquitination. Thus, DAPK3 is an essential kinase for STING activation that drives tumor-intrinsic innate immunity and tumor immune surveillance.",,Animals | Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols | Cell Line | Tumor | Death-Associated Protein Kinases genetics | Metabolism | Female | Gene Expression Regulation | Neoplastic | Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells | Humans | Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors | Immunity | Innate | Interferon-beta | Interferon-beta | LIM Domain Proteins | LIM Domain Proteins | Membrane Proteins | Membrane Proteins | Mice | Inbred C57BL | Mice | Knockout | Neoplasms | Neoplasms | Neoplasms | Neoplasms | Phosphorylation | Signal Transduction | Transcription Factors | Transcription Factors | Tumor Escape | Ubiquitination,La Jolla Institute of Immunology,Years,,Not Applicable ,Basic Research,,0,89

Activated memory B cells and binding or neutralizing antibody titers following vaccination correlated with protective efficacy. At suboptimal vaccine doses, viral breakthrough was observed but did not show enhancement of disease.

However, the emergence of viral variants that are more infectious than the earlier SARS-CoV-2 strains is concerning. Several of these viral variants have the potential to partially escape neutralizing antibody responses, warranting continued immune-monitoring. Methods: We used a panel of 30 post-mRNA vaccination sera to determine neutralization and RBD and spike binding activity against a number of emerging viral variants. The virus neutralization was determined using authentic SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates in an assay format that mimics physiological conditions. Findings: We tested seven currently circulating viral variants of concern/interest, including the three Iota sublineages, Alpha (E484K), Beta, Delta and Lambda in neutralization assays. We found only small decreases in neutralization against Iota and Delta. The reduction was stronger against a sub-variant of Lambda, followed by Beta and Alpha (E484K). Lambda is currently circulating in parts of Latin America and was detected in Germany, the US and Israel. Of note, reduction in a receptor binding domain and spike binding assay that also included Gamma, Kappa and A.23.1 was negligible. Interpretation: Taken together, these findings suggest that mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may remain effective against these viral variants of concern/interest and that spike binding antibody tests likely retain specificity in the face of evolving SARS-CoV-2 diversity.","Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine",SARS-CoV-2 variants | COVID-19 | COVID-19 mRNA vaccines | Antibodies | Neutralization activity | VoC,Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,Years,,Neutralizing binding activity to variant RBD and spike proteins.,Clinical Research,30,20,69

Here we show that patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) display early recruitment of B cells expressing a limited subset of IGHV genes, progressing to a highly polyclonal response of B cells with broader IGHV gene usage and extensive class switching to IgG and IgA subclasses with limited somatic hypermutation in the initial weeks of infection. We identify convergence of antibody sequences across SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, highlighting stereotyped naive responses to this virus.

To date, the CCP literature has focused largely on safety and efficacy outcomes, but little on implementation outcomes or experience. Expert opinion suggests that if CCP has a role in COVID-19 treatment, it is early in the disease course, and it must deliver a sufficiently high titer of neutralizing antibodies (nAb). Missing in the literature are comprehensive evaluations of how local CCP programs were implemented as part of pandemic preparedness and response, including considerations of the core components and personnel required to meet demand with adequately qualified CCP in a timely and sustained manner. To address this gap, we conducted an evaluation of a local CCP program at a large U.S. academic medical center, the University of North Carolina Medical Center (UNCMC), and patterned our evaluation around the dimensions of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to systematically describe key implementation-relevant metrics. We aligned our evaluation with program goals of reaching the target population with severe or critical COVID-19, integrating into the structure of the hospital-wide pandemic response, adapting to shifting landscapes, and sustaining the program over time during a compassionate use expanded access program (EAP) era and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) era. During the EAP era, the UNCMC CCP program was associated with faster CCP infusion after admission compared with contemporaneous affiliate hospitals without a local program: median 29.6 hours (interquartile range, IQR: 21.2-48.1) for the UNCMC CCP program versus 47.6 hours (IQR 32.6-71.6) for affiliate hospitals; (P<0.0001). Sixty-eight of 87 CCP recipients in the EAP (78.2%) received CCP containing the FDA recommended minimum nAb titer of ≥1:160. CCP delivery to hospitalized patients operated with equal efficiency regardless of receiving treatment via a RCT or a compassionate-use mechanism. It was found that in a highly resourced academic medical center, rapid implementation of a local CCP collection, treatment, and clinical trial program could be achieved through re-deployment of highly trained laboratory and clinical personnel.

Pregnant women are more susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 and are at higher risk of preterm birth than uninfected pregnant women. Despite this evidence, the immunologic effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy remain understudied. Objective: This study aimed to assess the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy on inflammatory and humoral responses in maternal and fetal samples and compare antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among pregnant and nonpregnant women. Study design: Immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were analyzed using samples from pregnant (n=33) and nonpregnant (n=17) women who tested either positive (pregnant, 22; nonpregnant, 17) or negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (pregnant, 11) at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We measured proinflammatory and placental cytokine messenger RNAs, neonatal Fc receptor expression, and tetanus antibody transfer in maternal and cord blood samples. In addition, we evaluated antispike immunoglobulin G, antispike receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G, and neutralizing antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in serum or plasma collected from nonpregnant women, pregnant women, and cord blood. Results: Pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection expressed more interleukin-1 beta, but not interleukin 6, in blood samples collected within 14 days vs >14 days after performing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test. Pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection also had reduced antispike receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G titers and were less likely to have detectable neutralizing antibody than nonpregnant women. Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection did not disrupt neonatal Fc receptor expression in the placenta, maternal transfer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 neutralizing antibody was inhibited by infection during pregnancy.

Additional SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses increase anti-spike IgG in some SOTRs, but it is uncertain whether neutralization of variants of concern (VOCs) is enhanced. We tested 47 SOTRs for clinical and research anti-spike IgG, pseudoneutralization (ACE2 blocking), and live-virus neutralization (nAb) against VOCs before and after a third SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose (70% mRNA, 30% Ad26.COV2.S) with comparison to 15 healthy controls after two mRNA vaccine doses. We used correlation analysis to compare anti-spike IgG assays and focused on thresholds associated with neutralization. A third SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose increased median total anti-spike (1.6-fold), pseudoneutralization against VOCs (2.5-fold vs. Delta), and neutralizing antibodies (1.4-fold against Delta). However, neutralization activity was significantly lower than healthy controls (p < .001); 32% of SOTRs had zero detectable nAb against Delta after third vaccination compared to 100% for controls. Correlation with nAb was seen at anti-spike IgG >4 Log10 (AU/ml) on the Euroimmun ELISA and >4 Log10 (AU/ml) on the MSD research assay.

Anti-Spike antibody levels and avidity were measured via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Overall, vaccination induced higher circulating anti-Spike protein immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels and avidity compared to infection at similar time intervals. Both vaccines produced similar anti-Spike IgG concentrations at 1 month, while mRNA-1273 demonstrated significantly higher circulating antibody concentrations after 4 months. mRNA-1273 induced significantly higher avidity at month 1 compared to BNT162b2 across all age groups.

Methods: From January 2021 through February 2022, we prospectively collected blood from 16 patients who were hospitalized at Massachusetts General for Children or Boston Children's Hospital for myocarditis, presenting with chest pain with elevated cardiac troponin T after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. We performed extensive antibody profiling, including tests for SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses and assessment for autoantibodies or antibodies against the human-relevant virome, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell analysis, and cytokine and SARS-CoV-2 antigen profiling. Results were compared with those from 45 healthy, asymptomatic, age-matched vaccinated control subjects. Results: Extensive antibody profiling and T-cell responses in the individuals who developed postvaccine myocarditis were essentially indistinguishable from those of vaccinated control subjects, despite a modest increase in cytokine production. A notable finding was that markedly elevated levels of full-length spike protein (33.9±22.4 pg/mL), unbound by antibodies, were detected in the plasma of individuals with postvaccine myocarditis, whereas no free spike was detected in asymptomatic vaccinated control subjects (unpaired t test; P<0.0001). Conclusions: Immunoprofiling of vaccinated adolescents and young adults revealed that the mRNA vaccine-induced immune responses did not differ between individuals who developed myocarditis and individuals who did not. However, free spike antigen was detected in the blood of adolescents and young adults who developed post-mRNA vaccine myocarditis, advancing insight into its potential underlying cause.","Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine",COVID-19 | mRNA | myocarditis | SARS-CoV-2 | vaccine | Antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD) assay | Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) assay | Antibody-mediated neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP) assay,"Ragon Institute of Mgh, Mit And Harvard",Years,01-Jan-2021,"Antibody profiling, T-cell responses, cytokine production and neutralization titers",Clinical Research,71,12,21

Cellular immune responses, particularly CD8+ T cell responses, probably contribute to protection against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection2-6. Here we show that cellular immunity induced by current vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike protein. Individuals who received the Ad26.COV2.S or BNT162b2 vaccines demonstrated durable spike-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses, which showed extensive cross-reactivity against both the Delta and the Omicron variants, including in central and effector memory cellular subpopulations. Median Omicron spike-specific CD8+ T cell responses were 82-84% of the WA1/2020 spike-specific CD8+ T cell responses. These data provide immunological context for the observation that current vaccines still show robust protection against severe disease with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant despite the substantially reduced neutralizing antibody responses","Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine",Vaccines | T cells | Vaccines | SARS-CoV-2,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center - Harvard Medical School,Years,,"humoral response to Nab, RBD binding antibodies, CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses",Clinical Research,47,22,67

Here, we collect longitudinal blood samples from 306 hospitalized COVID-19+ patients and 86 controls and perform bulk RNA sequencing of enriched neutrophils, plasma proteomics, and high-throughput antibody profiling to investigate relationships between neutrophil states and disease severity. We identify dynamic switches between six distinct neutrophil subtypes. At days 3 and 7 post-hospitalization, patients with severe disease display a granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell-like gene expression signature, while patients with resolving disease show a neutrophil progenitor-like signature. Humoral responses are identified as potential drivers of neutrophil effector functions, with elevated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)-to-IgA1 ratios in plasma of severe patients who survived. In vitro experiments confirm that while patient-derived IgG antibodies induce phagocytosis in healthy donor neutrophils, IgA antibodies predominantly induce neutrophil cell death. Overall, our study demonstrates a dysregulated myelopoietic response in severe COVID-19 and a potential role for IgA-dominant responses contributing to mortality.",,COVID-19 | neutrophil | IgA | G-MDSC | transcriptomics | NETosis | degranulation | SARS-CoV-2 | Antibody-mediated neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP) assay,"Ragon Institute of Mgh, Mit And Harvard",Years,01-Mar-2020,Clinical status and outcomes resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and hospitalization,Clinical Research,392,18,80

Antibody cocktails are being employed to mitigate these challenges, but neutralization escape remains a major challenge and alternative strategies are needed. Here we present two anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike binding antibodies, one Class 1 and one Class 4, selected from our non-immune human single-chain variable fragment (scFv) phage library, that are engineered into four, fully-human IgG-like bispecific antibodies (BsAb). Prophylaxis of hACE2 mice and post-infection treatment of golden hamsters demonstrates the efficacy of the monospecific antibodies against the original Wuhan strain, while promising in vitro results with the BsAbs demonstrate enhanced binding and distinct synergistic effects on neutralizing activity against circulating variants of concern. In particular, one BsAb engineered in a tandem scFv-Fc configuration shows synergistic neutralization activity against several variants of concern including B.1.617.2. This work provides evidence that synergistic neutralization can be achieved using a BsAb scaffold, and serves as a foundation for the future development of broadly reactive BsAbs against emerging variants of concern.",,Infectious diseases | Antibody therapy | Cryoelectron microscopy | SARS-CoV-2,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Years,,Not Applicable,Preclinical Study,,0,89

Therefore, it should be possible to exploit lectins to target SARS-CoV-2 and inhibit cellular entry by binding glycans on the spike protein. Burkholderia oklahomensis agglutinin (BOA) is an antiviral lectin that interacts with viral glycoproteins via N-linked high mannose glycans. Here, we show that BOA binds to the spike protein and is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry at nanomolar concentrations. Using a variety of biophysical approaches, we demonstrate that the interaction is avidity driven and that BOA cross-links the spike protein into soluble aggregates. Furthermore, using virus neutralization assays, we demonstrate that BOA effectively inhibits all tested variants of concern as well as SARS-CoV 2003, establishing that multivalent glycan-targeting molecules have the potential to act as pan-coronavirus inhibitors.",,SARS-CoV-2 | glycan shield | lectins,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Years,,Not Applicable,Basic Research,,0,89
