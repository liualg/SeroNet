0,PMID35915094_study-01,mRNA vaccines induce rapid antibody responses in mice,mRNA vaccines induce rapid antibody responses in mice,This study investigates how quickly mRNA vaccines elicit antibody responses compared to other vaccine modalities,"mRNA vaccines can be developed and produced quickly, making them prime candidates for immediate outbreak responses. Furthermore, clinical trials have demonstrated rapid protection following mRNA vaccination. Thus, we sought to investigate how quickly mRNA vaccines elicit antibody responses compared to other vaccine modalities. We first compared the immune kinetics of mRNA and DNA vaccines expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike in mice. We observed rapid induction of antigen-specific binding and neutralizing antibodies by day 5 following mRNA (4 µg/mouse), but not DNA (50 µg/mouse), immunization. Comparing innate responses hours post immunization, the mRNA vaccine induced increased levels of IL-5, IL-6, and MCP-1 cytokines which maybe promoting humoral responses downstream. We then evaluated the immune kinetics of an HIV-1 mRNA vaccine in comparison to DNA, protein, and rhesus adenovirus 52 (RhAd52) vaccines of the same HIV-1 envelope antigen in mice. Again, induction of envelope-specific antibodies was observed by day 5 following mRNA vaccination, whereas antibodies were detected by day 7–14 following DNA, protein, and RhAd52 vaccination. Thus, eliciting rapid humoral immunity may be a unique and advantageous property of mRNA vaccines for controlling infectious disease outbreaks.","other, CureVac AG",Not provided,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,Years,,Not Applicable ,,30,0,89

We describe three patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were persistently positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Viral viability from longitudinally-collected specimens was assessed. Whole-genome sequencing and serological studies were performed to measure viral evolution and evidence of immune escape. We found compelling evidence of ongoing replication and infectivity for up to 162 days from initial positive by subgenomic RNA, single-stranded RNA, and viral culture analysis. Our results reveal a broad spectrum of infectivity, host immune responses, and accumulation of mutations, some with the potential for immune escape. Our results highlight the potential need to reassess infection control precautions in the management and care of immunocompromised patients. Routine surveillance of mutations and evaluation of their potential impact on viral transmission and immune escape should be considered.",, SARS-CoV-2 | case report | immunocompromised | pediatric | persistent infection | variants,Stanford University,Years,07-May-2020,Infection control precautions in the management and care of immunocompromised patients,Clinical Research,3,2,21

We evaluated adverse events (AE) after messenger RNA vaccination in 246 adults with IBD participating in a longitudinal vaccine registry. In general, AE frequency was similar to that reported in the general population. AEs were more common among younger patients and those with previous COVID-19. AEs were less common in individuals receiving advanced therapies with biologics or small-molecule inhibitors. Those with IBD and other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases can be reassured that the AE risk is likely not increased, and may be reduced, while on advanced therapies.","Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna COVID-19 vaccine",Adult | Aged | Aged | 80 and over | COVID-19 Vaccines / adverse effects | Female | Humans | Inflammatory Bowel Diseases / complications | Longitudinal Studies | Male | Middle Aged | Vaccines | Synthetic / adverse effects | Young Adult,Cedars-sinai Medical Center,Years,,Adverse Events Following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccination,Clinical Research,246,20,85

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fails to distinguish acute from resolved infections, as RNA is frequently detected after infectiousness. We hypothesized that nucleocapsid in blood marks acute infection with the potential to enhance isolation and treatment strategies. In a retrospective serosurvey of inpatient and outpatient encounters, we categorized samples along an infection timeline using timing of SARS-CoV-2 testing and symptomatology. Among 1860 specimens from 1607 patients, the highest levels and frequency of antigenemia were observed in samples from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antigenemia was higher in seronegative individuals and in those with severe disease. In our analysis, antigenemia exhibited 85.8% sensitivity and 98.6% specificity as a biomarker for acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thus, antigenemia sensitively and specifically marks acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further study is warranted to determine whether antigenemia may aid individualized assessment of active COVID-19.",,Nucleocapsid |Antigenemia | COVID-19 | SARS-CoV-2,Emory University,Years,11-Jan-2021,Antigenemia frequency and levels in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients,Clinical Research,1607,21,90

The pervasiveness of VOCs suggests a high probability of future mutations that may lead to increased virulence. Prior reports have shown that VOC infection without expression of human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor (hACE2) in mice is possible. We sought to understand if the increased transmissibility of VOCs can infect C57BL/6 mice without expression of hACE2 receptor required for entry of SARS-CoV-2 normally. We examined the ability of infection with Beta and Gamma variants to infect and cause both pathological and clinical changes consistent with severe COVID-19, including body weight changes, survival, subgenomic viral titer, lung histology on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, and viral protein expression as measured by immunohistochemistry staining of viral antigen (IHC). These methods were used to examine three groups of mice: C57BL6, Rag2-/-, and Ccr2-/- mice. We observed that these mice, infected with Beta and Gamma variants of SARS-CoV-2, did not show pathological changes as indicated by weight loss, altered survival, or significant lung pathology on H&E staining. Subgenomic qPCR and IHC staining for viral protein indicated that there was some evidence of infection but far below ACE2 transgenic mice, which showed clinical disease and pathologic changes consistent with ARDS. These data suggest that these variants replicate poorly even in the setting of profound immune deficiency",,SARS-CoV-2 | Variants of concern | Immunocompromised mice,Tulane University,Years,,Not Applicable ,Basic Research,,0,89

In order to assay quantitative and qualitative differences in T cell responses, we adopted a high-resolution flow cytometry assay that incorporates multiple cytokines and activation markers. Such data are urgently required to guide masking, social distancing, and passive antibody/booster vaccination strategies for potentially vulnerable MM patients treated with these anti-cancer agents as we enter the second fall season of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna COVID-19 vaccine",2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273 | Antibodies | Viral blood | B-Lymphocytes drug effects | Immunology | virology | BNT162 Vaccine | COVID-19 | diagnosis | prevention & control | virology | COVID-19 Vaccines administration & dosage | Case-Control Studies | Cytokines | Blood | Host-Pathogen Interactions | Humans | Immunity | Cellular drug effects | Immunogenicity | Vaccine | Immunoglobulin G blood | Lymphocyte Activation drug effects | Immunoglobulin G | Lymphocyte Activation | Multiple Myeloma diagnosis| SARS-CoV-2 drug effects | SARS-CoV-2 immunology | SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity | Spike Glycoprotein | Coronavirus immunology | T-Lymphocytes | Treatment Outcome,Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,Years,,SARSCoV-2 specific B and T cell responses in vaccinated multiple myeloma patients,Clinical Research,56,37,81

Animal models can provide an opportunity to mechanistically interrogate causes of sex differences in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Adult male and female golden Syrian hamsters (8 to 10 weeks of age) were inoculated intranasally with 105 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2/USA-WA1/2020 and euthanized at several time points during the acute (i.e., virus actively replicating) and recovery (i.e., after the infectious virus has been cleared) phases of infection. There was no mortality, but infected male hamsters experienced greater morbidity, losing a greater percentage of body mass, developed more extensive pneumonia as noted on chest computed tomography, and recovered more slowly than females. Treatment of male hamsters with estradiol did not alter pulmonary damage.

Identification of positive and negative samples requires a classification strategy with low error rates, which is hard to achieve when the corresponding measurement values overlap. Additional uncertainty arises when classification schemes fail to account for complicated structure in data. We address these problems through a mathematical framework that combines high dimensional data modeling and optimal decision theory. Specifically, we show that appropriately increasing the dimension of data better separates positive and negative populations and reveals nuanced structure that can be described in terms of mathematical models. We combine these models with optimal decision theory to yield a classification scheme that better separates positive and negative samples relative to traditional methods such as confidence intervals (CIs) and receiver operating characteristics. We validate the usefulness of this approach in the context of a multiplex salivary SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G assay dataset. This example illustrates how our analysis: (i) improves the assay accuracy (e.g. lowers classification errors by up to 42 % compared to CI methods); (ii) reduces the number of indeterminate samples when an inconclusive class is permissible (e.g. by 40 % compared to the original analysis of the example multiplex dataset); and (iii) decreases the number of antigens needed to classify samples. Our work showcases the power of mathematical modeling in diagnostic classification and highlights a method that can be adopted broadly in public health and clinical settings.",,antibody | classification | diagnostics | measurement dimension probability models | SARS-CoV-2,National Institute of Standards And Technology,Years,,Not Applicable ,in silico Model,,0,89
